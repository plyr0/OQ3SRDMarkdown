# OQ3 SRD Equipment

## Currency

For ease of use here's a simple coin-based currency that will be used throughout the rest of this book to give value to an item.

5 Lead Bits (LB) = 1 Copper Penny (CP)

10 Copper Pennies (CP) = 1 Silver Piece (SP)

20 Silver Pieces (SP) = 1 Gold Ducat (GD)

## The Equipment Lists

Equipment lists make up the rest of this chapter. These lists provide the cost of the item and details any game effects. They also, where appropriate, give an Encumbrance value (ENC) for the item in question. Encumbrance is a value which rates both the weight and how physically unwieldy an object is. Encumbrance rules are given in The Quest chapter.

### Close Combat Weapons

All Close Combat weapons use the Close Combat skill. The following qualities characterise each close combat weapon:

_Damage Dice:_ The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

_Hands:_ The number of hands the weapon requires to use.

_ENC:_ The weapon's encumbrance a measure of its weight and bulk.

_Cost:_ The cost of silver pieces to purchase this weapon.

_Damage Dice:_ The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

_Rate:_ This shows how many missiles can be fired per Combat Rounds, taking into consideration the time to load the weapon. For example, 1 CR, means one missile every combat round, while 1/3 CR means one missile every three combat rounds.

_ENC:_ The weapon's encumbrance. The weight and bulk of the weapon.

_Cost:_ The price in silver pieces of the weapon.
