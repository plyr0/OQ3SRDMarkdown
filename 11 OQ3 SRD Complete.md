# OQ3 SRD Characters

## Character Generation

OpenQuest character generation is a seven-step process and, at each step, the player makes decisions about what their character is like at the beginning of the game, when the character is just starting on their adventuring career.

### Character Concept

A character concept is a one-sentence summing up of what the character is all about.

#### Step 1: Determine Concept

In one sentence, sum up what your character is all about. Use the guidelines above to give yourself ideas. Ask the other players what their character concepts are to make sure the group has an exciting selection of characters.

Check with your Referee that your character concept fits in with the type of game that the group is going to be playing.

### Characteristics

The characteristics are:

_Strength (STR):_ A character's capability with brute force, strength affects the amount of damage they deal, how much they can lift and so on.

_Constitution (CON):_ A measure of the character's health, constitution affects how much damage they can sustain in combat, as well as general resistance to disease and other illnesses.

_Dexterity (DEX):_ Dexterity is the character's agility, coordination and speed of reactions. This ability aids a character in many physical actions, including combat.

_Size (SIZ): Size_ is an indication of the character's mass and, like strength and constitution, affects the amount of damage a character can deal, and how well they can absorb damage.

_Intelligence (INT):_ A character's ability to think around problems, analyse information and memorise instructions.

_Power (POW):_ Power is a measure of the character's life force, the strength of their willpower, and a measure of how much magic power they have. It is a beneficial characteristic for those interested in becoming accomplished spellcasters.

_Charisma (CHA):_ This quantifies a character's attractiveness and leadership qualities.

#### Step 2: Generate Characteristics

##### Using the Points Method

Each characteristic starts with a value of 8. You have thirty points to distribute to increase them. The maximum value of a characteristic during character generation is 18. You may also lower a characteristic to gain extra points. For example, reduce STR from 8 to 6 to gain 2 points. Note that INT and SIZ cannot be decreased below 8. Other characteristics have a minimum value of 3, although such a low value would indicate that the character has a severe disadvantage in this area.

##### Random Generation of Characteristics (Optional)

If you prefer a more traditional method of rolling dice to create characteristics, follow this process.

For humans.

| **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **SIZ** | **INT** | **POW** | **CHA** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3D6 | 3D6 | 3D6 | 2D6+6 | 2D6+6 | 3D6 | 3D6 |

### Attributes

Attributes are a set of secondary scores that define the character's potential to do and take physical damage, how quickly they move, and the amount of magical energy available to the character. The character's characteristic scores determine the value of their attributes.

_Damage Modifier (DM):_ The Damage Modifier applies whenever the character uses a melee or thrown weapon. It's calculated by adding the character's Strength and Size together and referring to the table below. The modifier gets more significant when the sum of Strength and Size are higher –bigger, stronger, characters deal out more damage than smaller, weaker, characters.

***Damage Modifier***

| **Total of STR and SIZ** | **Damage Modifier** |
| --- | --- |
| 1–10 | –1D6 \* |
| 11–15 | –1D4 \* |
| 16–25 | +0 |
| 26–30 | +1D4 |
| 31–45 | +1D6 |
| 46–60 | +2D6 |
| 61-75 | +3D6 |
| 76-90 | +4D6 |
| Every additional + 15 | +1D6 |

\*If after you have taken away the rolled damage modifier and the damage is under 0, increase it to 1.

_Hit points (HP):_ These determine how much damage the character can sustain before reaching unconsciousness or death.

_Magic points (MP):_ A measure of the character's magical energy.Used to activate any spells the character knows.

_Movement rate (MR):_ This is the amount in metres that a character can move in a five-second Combat Round.

#### Step 3: Determine Attributes

To work out your character's damage modifier, add Strength and Size together and look at the Damage Modifier table.

Hit points equal Size plus Constitution divided by 2, rounded up.

The character's starting magic points will be equal to the character's POW.

Human characters have a Movement rate of 15 metres.

### Skills

Skills are things that the character can do. They represent particular areas of expertise. In-game, the percentage value of the skill is rolled against, using a D100, to work out if a character completes a task in the game. A roll equal to or less than the skill percentage indicates a success.

For example.

Ethelred has a Dodge of 52%, which means that in combat he has to roll 52 or under on D100 to avoid the incoming blows of his opponent.

#### What do the Numbers Mean?

The following table translates the skill percentage into a 'real world' description of the level of expertise.

***Skill Expertise***

| **Skill** | **Expertise** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-25% | Novice | No experience with the skill and is relying on raw talent and beginner's luck. |
| 26-50% | Apprentice | This level of expertise represents someone actively learning the skill. |
| 51-75% | Veteran | The character is competent with the basic uses of the skill, which they use in everyday life. |
| 76-99% | Expert | This character is a local expert at the skill, who can perform it under most conditions with ease and elegance. |
| 100% | Master | They are acknowledged as best at that skill, and regularly perform the impossible in challenging conditions. |

100% is the upper limit for skills, either through improvement or by being modified before a skill roll. Characters with skills at 100% are Masters of their skills, and always automatically succeed with a critical effect.

#### Skill Lists

Skills categorised for easy reference.

_Resistances_ are skills that get the character out of harm's way.

_Combat skills_ measure the character's skills in physical violence.

_Knowledge skills_ measure the intellectual abilities of the character.

_Practical skills_ measure the character's ability to perform a variety of everyday and specialist tasks.

_Magic skills_ cover either casting magic or knowledge of religious practices.

_A note about skills with descriptors in brackets._ Lore (Type), Religion (Other Religion) and Culture (Other) all have a descriptor in brackets after the main skill name

#### Skill Bases

***Resistances***

| Skill | Base |
| --- | --- |
| Dodge | DEX+10 |
| Persistence | POW+10 |
| Resilience | CON+POW |

***Combat Skills***

| Skill | Base |
| --- | --- |
| Close Combat | DEX+STR |
| Ranged Combat | DEX+INT |
| Unarmed Combat | DEX+STR |

***Knowledge Skills***

| Skill | Base |
| --- | --- |
| Culture (Own) | INT+10 |
| Language (Own) | INT+50 |
| Natural Lore | INT+10 |
| Culture (Other) | INT |
| Language (Other) | INT |
| Lore (Type) | INT |

***Practical Skills***

| Skill | Base |
| --- | --- |
| Athletics | DEX+STR |
| Craft | INT+10 |
| Deception | DEX+INT |
| Driving | DEX+INT |
| Engineering | INT+10 |
| Healing | INT+10 |
| Influence | CHA +10 |
| Mechanisms | DEX+INT |

***Magic Skills***

| Skill | Base |
| --- | --- |
| Personal Magic Casting | POW X 3 |
| Sorcery Casting | INT |
| Religion (Own Religion) | INT+10 |
| Religion (Other Religion) | INT |

#### Step 4: Calculate Skills

For each skill, calculate the starting skill value, also known as the base score, from the calculation provided. Then write it down on the character sheet next to the skill.

During character generation, the player gets a pool of points to spend on each group of skills. Distribute points between the skills, with a limit of no more than 30 to be allocated to any one skill.

_Resistances:_ Spend 50 points between the three skills.

_Combat:_ Spend 50 points between the three skills.

_Knowledge:_ Spend 50 points between the skills.

_Practical:_ Spend 75 points between skills.

_Magic:_ is special, refer to Generating a Character Step 5 below.

### Magic

#### Step 5: Magic Spells

Look at the spells in the Personal Magic chapter and pick six points of magnitude worth. Also work out Personal Magic Casting Skill, which starts at POW X 3.

### Equipment

Each character typically starts with some money and the tools of their trade.

#### Step 6: Cash and Equipment

- Starting cash is 4D6 x 10 in silver pieces unless you are using the optional rules to abstract resources using the Wealth skill.
- Each character starts with one of the two arms and armour packages below:
- Leather armour, ranged weapon, close combat 2H weapon and dagger.
- Leather armour, a medium or small shield, ranged weapon, close combat 1H weapon and dagger.
- Also, each character starts with the following equipment:
- A backpack, rope, two weeks' worth of travelling provisions, flint and tinder, and a waterskin.

Your Referee may allow you to buy additional equipment before the game starts from the character's starting cash.

### Finishing Off the Character

#### General Information

_Age:_ Human characters start at any age between 18 and 28. To randomly determine this, roll 2D6 and add 16.

_Fortune points:_ Every character starts with two fortune points.

#### What are Fortune Points?

Fortune points are what distinguishes the player character from the average stay at home type folk. They represent their good fortune and ability to escape life-threatening situations with ease.

Fortune points allow the player character to do any of the following in game.

- Re-roll any failed dice roll.
- Flip the existing dice result for a failed test so that the units are now the tens and the tens are now the units, so that it is a success.
- Avoid character death. Instead of dying, the character, if reduced to zero or fewer hit points, is merely unconscious. The character remains in such a state until the combat is over, at which point they awaken with one hit point.
- If the character uses Divine Magic, they can spend fortune points invoke their deity and regain a cast spell of their choosing.

Once spent, fortune points are gone. The Referee awards fortune at the end of the game session for moments of outstanding heroic play.

In an average Quest, each character should also receive two fortune points. Modify this total if the character has performed particularly poorly or heroically, giving a range of between zero and four fortune points to be awarded.

#### Background, Appearance and Personality

Even if you do not create a fully written-up background, it is worth making a mental note of what the character is like as a person and roughly what their background is previous to play, as well as visualising what they look like.

#### The Character's Background

The background is useful not only to give the character history before the game starts but also as a way of noting all the intangible elements of the character's personality. Ethelred's story later in this chapter is an example of a background.

Writing down a background is optional and can be done either before or after character generation or can even emerge during play.

#### **Motives**

Motives are what drives the character's actions. They are the character's goals, both short and long-term.

Saga Motives are life motives and are only achievable throughout a linked set of adventures, commonly known as a 'campaign' or Saga as OpenQuest calls it.

Quest Motives are usually relevant to the adventure currently being played and are determined near the beginning of the session by the players.

At the end of character generation, choose one Saga Motive for your character and at the beginning of the adventure, choose a suitable Quest Motive.

#### Step 7: Finish Off the Character

Note down fortune points and age.

For humans, this is 18-28 (2D6+16) respectively for starter adventurers.

Fortune points starts at 2.

Create at a Saga Motive for the character

If you want to include a background narrative, then do this now.

Finally, if you haven't done so already, write the character's name on the character sheet.

## Non-human adventurers (Optional)

With the Referee's permission, your character may be one of the creatures found in the Creatures chapter.

Use the random method to determine characteristics and roll the dice.

or

Take the value in brackets as the starting point and add ten points amongst them. Characteristics cannot be increased above the maximum value permitted by the random method (i.e. the maximum rollable plus three).

Make a note of the special abilities, traits, movement rates, natural armour and the natural weapons of the creature; damage base is as given, and skills start at Base Value.

Then determine skills and magic as normal, perhaps using the weapons and skills on the creature description which depict an average member of the species as a guide.

## Ready-Made Concepts

Ready-made concepts give quick ideas for players who are struggling to decide which skills and magic to choose.

Follow the character generation process up to the section on spending points on skills and choosing magic (steps 4 & 5). Instead of step 4 and 5, use the skill points and magic spells allocation as listed for the concept. Roll for money as normal but write down all the suggested equipment on the character sheet instead of the normal default adventuring starting equipment.

Each concept has the following components:

A name. A one-sentence summary of the concept.

• Skills. A ready-made points allocation for each of the skills groups.

• Personal Magic. Non-variable spells have the magic point cost in square brackets.

• Equipment.

So here we go here's an example of a ready-made concept for players who are stuck for ideas.

### Adventurous and Knowledge-Hungry Scholar

Skills:

Resistances: Dodge +30, Persistence +10, Resilience +10.

Combat: Close Combat+20, Ranged Combat+10, Unarmed Combat +20.

Knowledge: Language (Other) +20, Lore (Ancient Dead Civilisations) +30.

Practical: Athletics + 25, Influence +20, Perception +30.

Personal Magic: Coordination 2, Protection 2, Second Sight [2].

Equipment: Scholar's robes over leather armour, staff or dagger, and sling & stones.

## Character Growth

As characters go on Quests, they grow and improve. In the game, this can be one of the tangible goals for the players.

The main currency for achieving this and indicator of how well the character is doing in game terms are growth points or just simply growth. The Referee hands these out after a Quest.

Growth can happen because of three situations.

- _Bringing motives into play_, as determined by the player and approved by the Referee.
- _Quest achievement awards_. These are determined and handed out by the Referee.
- _In game rewards for skill use._ If the player fumbles or criticals during a skill test.
- _Ad hoc growth awards._ The Referee gives these out as a result of certain events occurring during the Quest.

### Awarding Growth for Motives

The characters' motives are the main way players get to drive play and grow their characters.

If your character completes a motive, either short or long term, during a gaming session, cross it out.

If you engage with a motive in a gaming session, bringing it in to play, but don't complete it, put a \* next to it. You can only mark growth once in this way per Quest.

Make sure you make these marks as soon as your character achieves them with your Referee's permission.

At the end of the Quest, look at your motives.

+5 growth points if you complete your Saga motive.

+2 growth points if you complete your Quest motive.

+1 for every motive that is brought into play. You don't get this award as well as the award for completing a motive.

As a result, you should have a total between 1 growth point (you engaged with your short-term Quest motive) and 7 growth points (you complete both your Quest motive and Saga motive).

At this point, rub out any asterisk markers and remove any short-term motives, whether completed or not. Leave the completed long-term motives on the character sheet.

#### **Motive Review**

At the end of each Quest, the player and the Referee can call for a Motive Review. During the review, the player can change Saga Motives that are no longer interesting to them or relevant to the character. They can also remove uncompleted Quest Motives or carry them over to the next Quest, in which case the Referee makes a note of them.

### Referee Growth Awards

The Referee award character growth as a result of the following.

- _Quest achievement award_ is directly linked to how long the quest was.
- _In game rewards for skill use._ If a character fumbles or criticals during a skill test, their player adds a growth point immediately.
- _Ad Hoc awards_ that acknowledge growth that occurs due to achievements outside of the standard growth system.

#### Quest Achievement Awards

At the end of a Quest, the Referee makes this award, a simple flat award of two growth points for each session of play of average length of two-three hours. Adjust for longer sessions.

For example, A self-contained one session one-shot game that took three hours should give two growth points, while a Quest that took four sessions, each two to three hours, to play out gives eight growth points to each player.

Note: if you want to reward clever or entertaining play, use fortune points instead.

#### In Game Rewards for Skill Use

If a character fumbles or criticals during a skill-test, they grow from the experience and the player immediately records a one-point growth award. The table should also cheer on the player. There is no limit to how many times this reward can be issued. The reward reflects this author's belief that we grow from great success or great failure.

#### Ad Hoc Awards

Ad hoc means when necessary or needed.

The characters may grow as part of the Quest in ways that are immediate and hard to fit within the context of awarding growth points and the Referee wants to make a one off award of a character growth directly linked to the Quest.

For example.

- A Wise may teach (for free) the spell of Detect Gold as a reward for completing a Quest on their behalf.

### Spending Growth Points

Players may spend growth points in the downtime between Quests, even when their characters who are badly injured are healing. The default downtime period is three months, although it could drop to mere days if the flow of time in the series of Quests, known as a Saga, requires it.

#### Growing Skills

A player may improve any number of skills by spending growth points, but each skill can only go up by +5%, during the downtime between adventures.

The cost of that growth depends on the expertise of the skill.

***Growth Costs by Expertise***

| **Skill** | **Expertise** | **Growth cost Per +5%** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-25% | Novice | 1 |
| 26-50% | Apprentice | 2 |
| 51-75% | Veteran | 3 |
| 76-99% | Expert | 5 |
| 100% | Master | 10 to reach 100% |

#### Growing Characteristics

A player can choose to spend five growth points to increase one characteristic by one point.

SIZ never increases using growth points.

The maximum a human character can increase a characteristic to is 21. For non-humans, the maximum for a characteristic is equal to the maximum possible starting score for the characteristic plus three.

This type of growth allows the character to overcome the innate weaknesses they suffer due to low characteristic scores.

#### Growing Magic

How the character learns more magic is dealt with in the respective magic chapters (Personal Magic, Divine Magic, and Sorcery). But for convenience the costs are summarised in the following table.

***Summary of Growth Costs***

| **Cost** | **Growth** |
| --- | --- |
| One growth point | +5% to Skill |
| Five growth points | +1 to any characteristic except SIZ |
| One growth point per magnitude | Learn a Personal Magic spell |
| Two growth points per magnitude | Learn a spell or an increase the magnitude of a Divine Magic spell |
| Three growth points | Learn a Sorcery Spell |

### Improving Outside of Quests: Practice And Research

The characters may often experience long stretches of downtime between Quests. Group members may need to heal from wounds suffered during the last Quest, the characters may engage in some activity that takes time, or life may return to normal until the next danger to face the player characters appears.

During such downtime, the characters may improve their characters. The players might request downtime between Quests to learn new skills, and it is up to the Referee to determine if this is appropriate.

For every three months of practice or research, a character may gain one growth point, which they can spend on growth. Note skills can only increase by +5% per downtime period.

### Improving in Magical Rank

There are growth point costs when a character increases their rank in their religions and in sorcery, and when they become a specialist caster using Personal Magic—explained in more detail in the relevant chapters, along with the benefits.

### Unlearning Spells and Changing Magical Path

Suppose characters change religions or even magic path. In that case, they may want to free up previously learnt magic spells, to learn a more powerful spell. For example, a character might change spells when they graduate from being Personal Magic users to users of Sorcery or Divine Magic, or learn the Divine Magic of their new religion if they change faith.

Characters may do this during downtime between adventures. The player describes how their character is spending time unlearning the spell and then, as long as they have a teacher or source of the new spell, they can learn it. Also, extra growth points from the character's current pool are added to the growth points freed up by unlearning the spell, to make up the total growth points needed to learn the new spell.

Also, they may return the growth points they spent to become a specialist caster (such as Shaman, Wise, Priest or Adept). They can then spend this growth on spells, or more likely on becoming a specialist caster in their new magical path.

# OQ3 SRD Skills

## The Basic Skill Test

The basic skill test is the unifying rules mechanic that does everything in OpenQuest. Roll a D100 and compare the result against a skill and depending on the result, apply the effect of success or failure.

To make a skill test, the player first describes what their character is doing. Then they roll a D100 and compare this to the relevant skill's score. If the dice roll is equal to or less than the skill's score, the attempt is successful. The player then describes the character's success. If the total is higher than the skill's score, then it has failed. The Referee then describes the result of the character's failure.

Under normal conditions, a skill test is asked for when the character is placed on the spot and must make a successful action under pressure.

### Unstressed Skill Tests

If the character has lots of time, has the tools of their trade and is in a sufficiently relaxed environment and state of mind, they complete the task to the best of their ability.

For example, an apprentice potter (Craft 20%) will, day in day out, produce a couple of pots of passable quality if working at their Master's workshop. Of course, work beyond the skill of the character is still out of their reach, unless the player decides to take the chance with the dice and ask for a skill test.

A local noble wants an artistic piece of pottery for a grand celebration later in the month. The noble's servant comes to the potter's workshop, looking for the Master, who is out. The apprentice, seeing a chance to gain a good reputation, takes the commission. Knowing that his regular work will not be up to scratch, the player decides to roll the dice in the chance that he can produce something of the standard the noble expects.

### If the Outcome is Hazardous

BEFORE THE SKILL TEST IS MADE, the Referee should also outline what any potential hazards there are if the character should fail. Players should be allowed to choose an alternative course of action. Also, the Referee should not apply extra penalties if the skill test is failed, or even fumbled (see below).

## The Basic Skill Test Procedure

Overall, the procedure is as follows.

1. The Referee calls for a skill test and asks the player to roll against a specific skill to resolve the current situation.
2. The player describes how their character is tackling the task at hand.
3. If there are any hazards or penalties for failing the task, the Referee should declare them, and the player should be allowed the option to plot an alternative route for their character, which may allow them to change the skill being used.
4. If the character has any active magic from spells or items that gives them a bonus or penalty, apply this to the skill now.
5. The Referee decides if the situation modifies the difficulty of the skill roll. Whether there is a bonus or a penalty (but not both and not multiple modifiers) to be applied to the skill before the player rolls the dice. See Difficulty below.
6. The player rolls D100 and compares it against their skill, which may be modified.

- If the roll is lower or equal to the skill's value, they succeed. The player describes how the character succeeds.
- If it is higher, they fail. The Referee describes how they fail.
- If they succeed and both dice are the same number, then the result is a critical success.
- If they fail and both dice are the same number, then the result is a fumble.

## Success

If you roll equal to or lower than your modified skill total, you are successful.

You can now describe what the character does as they succeed.

The character gets an automatic success if the modified skill is over 100%, but you still roll to see if you get a critical success.

### **Critical Successes**

If the dice roll on a skill test is successful and both dice are the same (i.e. '11', '22', '33', etc.), then a critical success is achieved.

Critical success has an outcome that far exceeds the expectation of the player. It's the best possible result based upon what skill the character used to perform the test.

The actual result of a critical success during a skill test is up to the player. It usually achieves one of the following results:

- Quicker.
- The result is to a higher standard.
- With more style, impressing any audience they may have.
- The character gains additional information or insight from the task thanks to their brilliance.
- If the character is causing damage as a result of the skill test, they cause maximum damage and ignore any armour or protection that their opponent may have.

The Referee can moderate the critical result, vetoing or suggesting more reasonable outcomes if the player tries to narrate more success than is reasonable, but the player always suggests the effect.

## Failure

If the dice roll on a skill test is higher than the modified skill, then a failure occurs. The Referee narrates the failure and its effect.

Note: The Referee should take care not to penalise the character with multiple effects for failing. The result of failing should be straightforward and as a direct result of the character's actions.

If the Referee has previously outlined the risks of failure, then they should implement that as a result. They should not suddenly change their mind.

### **Failing Forward**

Failure of a basic skill test should never stop the character from progressing through the adventure. There should always be options and possibilities, even when the player fails a skill test. A process which is known as failing forward.

Here are some examples of fail forward situations.

- The characters fail to pick or force a locked door? Their efforts make enough noise to alert a patrol of passing guards, who now come crashing through the door ready for trouble. The characters must think fast, do they respond with violence or make up a convincing story and fast talk their way past the guards?
- The characters all failed their Perception skill tests to notice an iron key hidden in a rubbish pile while searching a room earlier, and now that they have found a locked chest. Will they break it open or get their lock picks out?
- The group's Sorcerer failed their Language skill test to decipher an ancient text about an ancient Demon they are about to face. The adventurers still face the horror, but they do not know its weaknesses or the spell that the scroll outlined.

Failure should not be a barrier to resolving the adventure but instead should open interesting difficulties to resolve.

### **Fumbles**

Whenever a skill test results in failure and both rolled dice are the same number, the character has 'fumbled' the test.

A fumble is the worst possible outcome of the skill test based upon the player's original description of what their character was planning to do.

The actual result of a fumble is primarily up to the Referee to decide. It usually results in one of the following mishaps.

A fumble need not lead to damage and the demise of the character, but should always cause the character to suffer a significant disadvantage.

### Fumbling Forward?

Unlike a simple failure, fumbling should be a dead end to play, to emphasise how bad things are. All the character can do is dust themselves off and take another route to success.

There are specific Critical Success and Fumble results for weapon skill tests in combat and magical casting skill tests, described in the relevant chapters (Combat and Magic).

## Difficulty

If the conditions and situation are different from those usual, the Referee may modify the skill to reflect the difference in difficulty. Modifiers are added or subtracted from the skill for the duration of the test. A penalty will make the test harder while a bonus makes it easier. Only one modifier is used during a test. (See When a Referee Should Apply Difficulty Modifiers below for guidance on this.)

***Difficulty Modifiers***

| **Difficulty** | **Skill Modifier** | **What the modifier means** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | +50% | The character should have an almost certain chance of success. |
| Simple | +20% | While success is still by no means certain, the character has a boost to their chance of achieving their goal. |
| Normal | +0% | The skill is unmodified since normal conditions apply. |
| Difficult | –20% | Significantly hindered in their chance of success. |
| Hard | –50% | Suffering a severe setback that may put success beyond their reach. |

## Impossible Success And Automatic Failure

Any skill modified to 0 or less will automatically fail when tested. Roll dice anyway since the character can still fumble.

Any skill modified to 100% or higher will almost always automatically succeed when tested. Roll the dice anyway since the character can be still make a critical success or fumble if the player rolls a 00. This rule of 00 being an automatic fumble does not apply to a character who is a Master of the skill.

## When the Referee Should Apply Difficulty Modifiers

Modifiers should only be applied when they have a significant effect on the character's chance of success. They should not be doled out for every skill test since this cheapens their dramatic impact. Only apply a modifier when it is essential and brings something to the story. Resist the urge to hand out +10% here and take -5% there. These little modifiers do not add much to the player's chance of success and bring needless fiddly addition and subtraction into play.

There are three areas where the Referee should modify the player's skill before a skill test. The Referee should consider all three areas and decide which of them provides the deciding factor, and only apply the modifier based on that.

For example, if the player has roleplayed his character to the hilt while influencing a guardsman in the pouring rain, it is the roleplaying for which the Referee awards a +50% bonus and not the rain, which would have dampened the enthusiasm of the guardsman to -20%. So, only +50% applies to the player's roll.

The three areas are:

- As a result of the task being inherently easy or difficult.
- As a result of planning.
- As a result of good roleplaying.

### As a Result of the Task Being Inherently Easy or Difficult

Some things are just naturally easier or harder to do than others.

For example, climbing a cliff with natural handholds and with the proper equipment (e.g. ropes and iron spikes) is an unmodified task. Doing the same climb in the pouring rain makes it Difficult (-20% to the skill) and if the character has also forgotten his ropes and spikes, then this makes it Hard (-50% to the skill).

In comparison, climbing a cliff where there are numerous ledges, and where the character can rest and actually 'walk' up the cliff in places becomes an Easy (+50%) skill test.

### As a Result of Planning

The players have outlined how their characters prepare to perform a task well in advance. If their plan is a sound and good one, you should make the skill test Easy. Conversely, if the players have given no thought as to how their characters approach a complex task which does require preparation and planning, then make the resulting skill test Hard.

### As a Result of Good Roleplaying

Usually, this happens with skills that involve some form of communication, like Influence. When the player describes the action of their character and roleplays the exchange between their character and the non-player character(s). If the player was entertaining, kept in character and added to the fun of the game, the Referee may award them a +20% or +50% bonus. In exceptional circumstances, where the player reduced everyone to tears of laughter or was outstanding in their portrayal of their character, the Referee may waive the necessity for the skill test entirely. Remember, good storytelling always comes before any dice rolling.

## Modifiers for Magic

Suppose the character is under the influence of a magic spell or item, that gives them a penalty or bonus to the skill they are using. In this case, the modifier for magic is added or subtracted after the modifier for difficulty.

Like modifiers for difficulty, apply one modifier in any given skill test. Pick the most powerful one, be it a bonus or a penalty.

## Opposed Skill Tests

Opposed skill tests are made by both characters who are in direct competition with each other. Both characters make the skill tests, as usual, rolling 1D100 and attempting to roll equal to or under their skill.

### One Character Succeeds

If one character succeeds their skill test and the other fails, then the successful character has won the opposed skill test.

### Both Characters Succeed

If both characters succeed, then whoever rolled the highest in their skill test wins the opposed test. If one character rolls a critical, while the other rolls an ordinary success, then the character that rolled the critical, which is a higher level of success, wins.

### Both Characters Fail

Whoever rolled the lowest in their skill test wins the opposed test.

In the case of ties for both the player wins.

### Difficulty Modifiers in Opposed Skill Tests

Only one side of the opposed skill test is modified. Either whoever has the clear advantage or clear disadvantage. You do not modify both sides.

### Magic in an Opposed Skill Test

Both sides can use magic in an opposed skill test, which generates skill modifiers. Like a normal skill test these modifiers are applied after the difficulty modifier.

***Opposed Tests Results***

| **Player / Opponent** | **Critical** | **Success** | **Failure** | **Fumble** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Highest Roll Wins | Player Wins | Player Wins | Player Wins |
| Success | Opponent Wins | Highest Roll Wins | Player Wins | Player Wins |
| Failure | Opponent Wins | Opponent Wins | Lowest Roll wins | Player Wins |
| Fumble | Opponent Wins | Opponent Wins | Opponent Wins | Nobody Wins |

## Skills at 100%

Characters with skills at the limit of 100% are Masters of that skill and under normal circumstances do not fail and quite often can perform tasks that are deemed impossible by ordinary people.

### Skill Tests and Masters

Characters who have 100% with a particular skill never roll to test their skill, and the outcome is an automatic critical. Because they do not need to test their skill, they never fail or fumble skill tests with that skill.

### Opposed Tests vs Masters

In opposed skill tests characters with skills at 100% nearly always succeed. There are two cases that need consideration.

If the player character is a Master and their opponent is also a Master. In this case, the player rolls the dice as normal, and if they get a critical, they win the contest. Otherwise, they tie, and the contest is a standoff with neither side getting any advantage.

If the opponent is a Master and the character is not. The player rolls the test for their character's skill. The Master has already considered to have a critical by the fact that they are at 100%, so the Referee needs not roll. If player rolls a critical, the player character wins by the barest and most amazing of margins. If the player succeeds, the Master wins in less style than they normally would, which might be impressive in its own right to any crowd watching. The player character rolls a fail or fumble, they fumble.

### Characters Whose skill is Modified to 100%

Characters who during a basic skill test or opposed skill contest have their skill modified to 100%, are not treated as Masters. While a modified skill of 100% still guarantees them a success, unless they fumble a roll of 00, they still have to roll to see if they get a critical.

## Group Skill Tests

Sometimes the Referee will call for everyone around the table to make the same skill test. These tests are made as individuals. For example, a Perception Test to notice the bandits hidden in the bushes on either side of the path the characters are currently travelling along. Those characters who make their tests can act on the information that it provides. Those who don't can't. Characters can also critical or fumble as normal. Determining Surprise in the Combat chapter is another example of this.

## Assistance

Characters will often help each other during skill tests. Often such assistance will break a deadlock where a character cannot successfully do a task on their own. Only one assistance may be taken at a time, but it may add to the modifier that the character making the skill test has already gained. Note: If the character is doing this in combat, they act on the turn of the character they are helping. They lose their own turn. Therefore, they cannot assist if they have already acted in that round.

Assistance Procedure.

1. Choose an appropriate skill, which need not be the same as the skill which the character they are assisting is using. Make the skill roll and narrate how your character is helping.
2. The Referee determines if the character is actually in a position to help.
3. If the Referee approves, add +20% to the skill of the character you are helping.

## Skill Descriptions

Here is the full list of skills in alphabetical order.

### Athletics (DEX+STR)

This broad skill covers a range of athletic activities useful to adventuring characters, including acrobatics, climbing, jumping and swimming.

_Acrobatics:_ This allows a character to perform a variety of gymnastics and balancing tasks, such as tumbling, walking a tightrope or keeping balance on a narrow or unstable ledge. The character can move at half their normal speed across an unstable surface without penalty. To move at a normal rate requires an Acrobatics test. A successful Acrobatics test will also halve the damage suffered from falling.

_Brute Force:_ Brute force is an application of Athletics that relies purely on power, with no finesse involved. Brute force involves pushing, lifting or dragging.

_Climbing:_ Given enough hand and footholds, a character can climb any surface, given enough time, without the need for a test. Under normal circumstances, a character can ascend or descend one-quarter of their Movement per Combat Round (see Chapter 5 Combat for details). A character can double the rate of their climb or descent by making a Hard Athletics test.

_Jumping:_ In general, a successful Athletics test allows a character to jump up to twice their height horizontally or up to half their height vertically, if they have at least five metres to run first. For standing jumps, half these distances. For humans, average height is roughly 1.8m which gives a jumping distance of 4m.

For greater distances, the Referee can apply a -20% or even -50% penalty. If the distance involved is absurd, the Referee should feel free to say the test is impossible

_Swimming:_ Characters usually swim at half their usual movement. Athletics tests are only required when conditions are less than ideal – swimming while heavily encumbered or in strong currents, for example.

### Close Combat (DEX+STR)

This skill deals with the art of hitting things and defending the character with melee weapons, such as swords, clubs, spears, polearms and shields.

### Craft(INT+10)

This skill is a grouping of several disciplines, that measures the character's ability to make and repair items.

As a very rough guide, it takes one day per 50 SP to produce an item. The base cost of the article in materials needed is 50% of the listed finished value.

### Culture (Own) (INT+10) /Culture (Other) (INT)

Each Culture skill provides information about the prevailing worldview of that group of people (or creatures), which includes history, politics, weather cycles, geography, superstitions, and popular mythology.

Culture (Own) is the worldview of the people by whom the character is raised. All other foreign or alien cultures are Culture (Other). Culture (Other) is a collection of skills, one for each culture.

### Deception (DEX+INT)

Deception covers the arts of:

_Disguise:_ Used to change a character's appearance and adopt a different outward persona.

_Sleight:_ Used to hide or take objects, without drawing undue attention.

_Stealth:_ Used whenever a character attempts to evade detection by another character personally. Usually, this happens when a character either tries to creep past an enemy, hide from one, or performs a combination of both.

When testing the skill, Deception is often opposed by the Perception skill and is modified according to the situation. Note that attempts at Fast Talk use the Influence skill rather than Deception.

### Dodge (DEX+10)

The Dodge skill is used to avoid incoming objects that are swung or thrown at the character. The skill is usually used when a character attempts to dodge an incoming blow in combat or a physical hazard that can be avoided, such as falling masonry.

### Driving (DEX+INT)

If a character is driving a wagon, chariot, or similar vehicle, at no more than walking pace across flat terrain, a Driving skill test will never be required. Skill tests are needed when a character wants to do something out of the ordinary with a vehicle – such as to travel across treacherous terrain, jump obstacles and so on.

### Engineering (INT+10)

This skill is used to design, build, activate, repair, sabotage or disassemble large mechanisms or constructs, such as siege machines, city gates and drawbridges, mine-shafts, sailing ships and so forth.

### Healing (INT+10)

Use of this skill will always require a healer's kit, which includes suitable medical equipment, such as bandages and salves, or an appropriate improvised alternative. Each use of the Healing skill generally takes a few minutes to perform. Both characters must remain stationary and may not use combat actions or reactions while this occurs or they will lose the benefits of the healing.

See the following table for the range of Healing actions available to the characters using this skill.

All healing actions are stressful, so they always require a skill test to perform successfully.

***Healing Actions***

| **Injury or Ailment** | **Treatment** |
| --- | --- |
| Unconsciousness | A successful Healing test can revive a character from unconsciousness. |
| Minor Injury (any wound taken while total hit points over zero) | A successful Healing test on a Minor Injury will heal 1D6 Hit Points. |
| Stabilise Mortal Wound (character less than zero hit points) | A successful Healing test on a Mortal Wound (where hit points are less than zero) will not restore the lost Hit Points. This Healing merely stabilises the patient enough so that they will not die of blood loss. |
| Curing Diseases | A successful Healing test allows a diseased patient to add a bonus to his next opposed test of Resilience versus disease Potency to resist the disease. The bonus is equal to the healer's Healing skill divided by 10. |
| Curing Poisons | A successful Healing test allows a poisoned patient to attempt a second opposed test of Resilience versus poison Potency. The patient gains a bonus to their Resilience skill equal to the healer's Healing skill divided by 10. |
| Surgery | Other than magical healing, successful Surgery is the only way that a character can recover from a Mortal Wound. Once a successful Healing test has been made to quench the bleeding of a Mortal Wound, a successful Healing test can attempt to set broken bones, stitch together rent flesh and restore the wound location so that it is on the road to recovery. If the Healing test is a success, the stricken character gains one hit point and will begin to heal as usual. |

### Influence (CHA+10)

This skill is the art of verbally persuading another character to do what you want.

Influence skill tests are usually opposed by either Persistence (as a measure of sheer bloody-minded will power) or Influence (where the character argues back). They are further modified by how much a character is trying to change an opponent's mind. Influence skill tests are often modified by how well the player roleplays the exchange (see "When the Referee should apply difficulty modifiers" above).

Influence can be used in one of three ways.

- _Fast Talk_. The character tries to quickly confuse either an individual or small group with a clear leader, into doing what they want.
- _Oratory._ The character puts forward a series of arguments to sway a large crowd of people.
- _Intimidation_. The character tries to use the threat of violence against an opponent or group of opponent.

See the Social Combat section for more.

### Language (Own) (Int+50)/Language (Other) (INT)

The Language skill is several separate skills grouped under a single heading. Language (Gatanese), Language (Dark Lander) and Language (Goblinoid), for example, are all individual skills.

Every character with a Language skill of 50% or more is fluent in that language, although they are likely to have an accent if it is not their native language.

A score in a Language skill of 80% or more will mean the character can also read and write in that language.

### Lore (Area of Knowledge) (INT)

The Lore skill is an umbrella term for several different skills, each of which must be improved separately.

Each Lore skill defines an area of knowledge for the character, and whenever a player wants to see if their character knows something about the subject at hand they use that specific Lore skill.

A player's imagination is the only limit to the range of possible Lores. Example Lores include: alchemy, art, astronomy, gambling, geography, heraldry, law, logistics, military tactics, philosophy, poisons.

### Mechanisms (DEX+INT)

The Mechanisms skill is used for picking a lock or disassembling a trap. Usually, this takes at least one minute (12 combat rounds) to perform, whereas larger or particularly complex devices will take longer.

Usually, a character will merely make a Mechanisms test to succeed at assembling or disassembling a device, with appropriate bonuses or penalties decided upon by the Referee. If a device has been designed to resist attempts at disassembly specifically, the Mechanisms test becomes opposed by the Mechanisms skill of the character who created it.

### Natural Lore (INT+10)

Broadly speaking, this Lore deals with the character's knowledge of the natural world. It can be broken into five specialist areas.

_Animal:_ This covers the ability to recognise an animal, know its feeding habits, breeding cycle, habitats and so on. A character with a skill of at least 50% may try to domesticate a wild animal, making a skill test after every full week of training. If the character also has a Riding skill of at least 50% and the animal is capable of being ridden, they may train the animal to be ridden during this period. The character may later train the animal not to panic in battle and to strike at his enemies, after a further period of training, with the character making a skill test at the end of each week to succeed.

_Plant:_ A character can identify plants in the wild, discover the right places to grow crops, decide which plants are edible and what unusual properties they may possess.

_Mineral:_ This skill allows the character to detect precious metals and stones, detect fault lines and other dangerous features in the rock, etc.

_Survival:_ One Survival test will be required every day that a character lacks either food, water or a safe place to sleep. Success indicates the character manages to find whatever they lack – failure means they will go without, which over several days could result in severe consequences. Survival tests aren't called for when the character is in a city or town.

_Tracking:_ With this skill, a character can locate the tracks of a specific creature and follow them while in the wilderness.

_Weather:_ The character can predict changes in the climate.

### Perception (INT+POW)

The Perception skill is used to represent the five senses of the character when detecting objects or other characters. For example, a typical use of the Perception skill is as a straight skill test to identify hidden objects in a room or as an opposed test to discover a hidden character.

### Performance (CHA+10)

A successful test with this skill will result in the audience or partner being pleased by the character's performance. This skill covers acting, composing poetry, dancing, singing, readings and playing an instrument.

### Persistence (POW+10)

Persistence represents a character's mental willpower. It is used to resist the effects of magic and to resist another character's attempt to use the Influence skill against them.

### Personal Magic Casting (POW X 3)

This skill represents the character's ability to cast Personal Magic spells. It also describes their knowledge about Personal Magic (see the dedicated chapter for further details).

### Ranged Combat (DEX+ INT)

This skill covers the use of missile weapons, such as bows, crossbows, thrown spears and thrown daggers. See the Combat chapter for more detail.

### Religion (Own) (INT+10)/Religion(Other)(INT)

Religion is used to recall knowledge of a religious nature, though the character will only be able to remember knowledge pertinent to the specified religion.

Learning Religion (Own) requires a character to be at least a lay member of a religion. Normally, a character will only be a member of one religion. So, Religion (Other) usually relates to foreign religions and is learned through observation or being taught by a member of the religion in question.

The Religion skill is not needed actually to cast Divine magic. Still, it is used to advance in status and power within the Religions that the character is a member of and to grant access to higher magnitudes of Divine magic.

### Resilience (CON+POW)

A measure of how physically tough a character is. The higher a character's Resilience, the more likely they are to handle adverse physical conditions, such as weathering a vicious sandstorm, surviving in a drought or overcoming the effects of poison or disease.

### Riding (DEX+POW)

If a character is riding a creature with the help of saddle and stirrups, at no more than a walking pace across flat terrain, then a Riding test will never be required. Tests are required when a character wants to do something out of the ordinary with a mount – such as travel across treacherous terrain, jump obstacles, ride bareback and so on.

### Sailing (DEX+INT)

This skill covers small water-borne craft propelled manually by oars or paddles, commonly known as boats, and larger craft powered by sail or rows of oars. Travelling across calm water does not usually require a skill test, but adverse conditions such as currents and weather can bestow penalties.

### Sorcery Casting (INT)

This skill covers the successful casting of Sorcery spells which the caster knows, and also the ability to manipulate the effects, range and duration of those spells. This skill also allows the use of magic items with stored spells (commonly called Matrices) and scrolls with Sorcery spells written on them. It can also be used to represent the character's knowledge of Sorcery and its works. See the Sorcery Chapter for details.

### Streetwise (CHA+POW)

Streetwise allows a character to find fences for stolen goods, black markets and uncover general information in an urban setting. Such uses of Streetwise usually require a minimum of 1D4 hours. Streetwise also covers following people down crowded city streets.

### Trade (INT+10)

This skill is used when characters trade, barter or otherwise negotiate over the sale of goods. In such transactions, a successful opposed test using the Trade of the buyer versus the Trade of the seller is needed for the buyer to get the best deal. If the buyer wins, they receive a discount, -10% for success, -20% for a critical. If the seller wins, the price that they can sell the item for increases by +10% for success and +20% for a critical. If the opponent fumbles their roll, double the increase or decrease.

The Trade skill also enables the character to determine the value placed on something by others; by estimating its market value. Everyday or obscure objects might give a bonus or penalty to the skill test. Success will allow a character to guess the average monetary value of the object, usually guessing accurately to within 10% of its actual value.

### Unarmed Combat (DEX+STR)

This skill covers the use of natural attacks. For humans, this is punching, kicking, and grappling. Non-human characters may also have bite, horn, claw and tail attacks.

| **Weapon** | **Damage Dice** |
| --- | --- |
| Unarmed | 1D4 |
| Natural weaponry | As noted, typically 1D4 to 1D12 depending on the creature (see Creature Chapters) |

### Wealth (Optional) (INT+CHA)

This skill shows the resources and physical possessions a character has. For a beginning character, it is based upon what they have earned using their wits and charm alone. The basic skill is (INT + CHA), and this can be increased by spending skill points at character generation. If you are determining starting wealth by social class, set the minimum in the skill according to social rank (i.e. the base score as shown in the table below). For example, a Minor Noble would have a Wealth of 86%.

Wealth can be used as an abstract measure of material resources in the game. A character who has the equivalent Wealth level to a piece of equipment's purchase cost can automatically buy it. If the piece of equipment's cost is one level above the character's wealth, then the character will need to make a wealth test.

If they succeed, the item is theirs. The next wealth test is at -20%. This modifier lasts for a month.

If they fail, they do not have enough spare cash at the time that they try to buy the item and must free up some of their savings or wait until they are paid again at the end of their current job.

If they fumble, they will find that they have a cash flow problem and cannot make any Wealth tests for at least a month, and they must spend time and effort sorting out their financial difficulties.

If they roll a critical, they find they have more than enough disposable income and can make their next Wealth test without a penalty.

***What Wealth Means***

# OQ3 SRD Equipment

## Currency

For ease of use here's a simple coin-based currency that will be used throughout the rest of this book to give value to an item.

5 Lead Bits (LB) = 1 Copper Penny (CP)

10 Copper Pennies (CP) = 1 Silver Piece (SP)

20 Silver Pieces (SP) = 1 Gold Ducat (GD)

## The Equipment Lists

Equipment lists make up the rest of this chapter. These lists provide the cost of the item and details any game effects. They also, where appropriate, give an Encumbrance value (ENC) for the item in question. Encumbrance is a value which rates both the weight and how physically unwieldy an object is. Encumbrance rules are given in The Quest chapter.

### Close Combat Weapons

All Close Combat weapons use the Close Combat skill. The following qualities characterise each close combat weapon:

_Damage Dice:_ The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

_Hands:_ The number of hands the weapon requires to use.

_ENC:_ The weapon's encumbrance a measure of its weight and bulk.

_Cost:_ The cost of silver pieces to purchase this weapon.

_ENC:_ The weapon's encumbrance. The weight and bulk of the weapon.

_Cost:_ The price in silver pieces of the weapon.

***Ranged Weapon Ammunition***

| Crossbow bolts (10) | — | 2 SP |
| Sling bullets (10) | — | 5 CP |

#### Using Ranged Weapons in Close Combat

Unless the weapon can be used in close combat, and has an entry in that table, a ranged weapon is treated as an improvised weapon, doing damage equal to its closest hand-to-hand equivalent if that is less than its ranged weapon damage.

***Ranged Combat Weapons***

| Weapon | Damage | Hands | Range | Rate | ENC | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

_ENC:_ The armour's encumbrance. The weight and bulk of the armour.

_Cost:_ The cost of the armour in silver pieces.

#### **Effects of SIZ on Armour**

Armour made for a character of SIZ 1 to 5 will have its cost and ENC halved from that shown on the Armour table. Characters of SIZ 21 or higher will double the cost and ENC for armour made for them.

_Plate Armour:_ Characters may try using plate armour not designed for them, but at double ENC.

_Layering Armour:_ Characters may not wear more than one type of armour, i.e. layer armour, to get increased Armour Points.

# OQ3 SRD Combat

## Social Combat

### Starting Combat

For social combat to occur, two things have to happen first.

_The combatants must be in range._ Social combat can't happen if the characters involved can't hear each other. See Guidelines on the Range of Social Combat below.

_They must understand each other._ Social combat works best if the combatants involved are speaking the same language. It can occur if they have a basic level of understanding, through gestures or being able to understand some key phrases due to the languages being in the same language family. See Limits of Understanding below.

#### Range of Social Combat

This type of combat can only occur if combatants are in speaking distance. Usually, this is within close range (up to two metres) but can also happen at a ranged distance with opponents being up to 50 meters away,

At close range, the character can speak without penalty. Beyond that, apply a -20% penalty to the speaker's Influence skill. A Master of the Influence skill has learnt to project their voice and does not suffer that penalty.

Beyond fifty metres, the character cannot use Influence to attack targets using social combat techniques, without the aid of magic. The spell Thunder's Voice is an example of a magic spell that allows Intimidation attempts at up to 100m!

#### Limits of Understanding

Social combat can only occur if the combatants can understand each other. If the player can convincingly explain how they can communicate their argument using sign language and gestures, they can take -20% to their Influence in Intimidation conflicts. They cannot attempt Fast Talk or Oratory, which requires more elaborate conversational language.

### Fast Talk

This method of Social Combat is where a character tries to quickly convince another that their point of view is valid or confuse them into accepting something that isn't true. It's a quick conversation that lasts a couple of minutes. Roll 1D6 to determine the exact length in minutes if the timing is important. It is also one character against another. Fast Talk also works against small groups of up to ten individuals, where the group has an established leader that the character can aim their attack at, and their subordinates will follow their lead. Fast Talk only works in situations where the target is within clear speaking distance.

The procedure for making a Fast Talk is as follows:

1. The player whose character is doing the Fast Talk roleplays what their character is saying and announces what they want the successful outcome to be.
2. The character doing Fast Talk makes an opposed skill test using Influence. The target may defend with one of three skills. Their Influence, if they are actively arguing back; their Persistence skill, if they are relying on sheer will power to resist the other character's persuasion; or a Lore Skill if the character is trying to trick them in an area where they are knowledgeable.
3. If the Fast Talker succeeds, they convince the target. The target remains convinced for 1D20 minutes before they realise they've been bamboozled.
4. If the Fast Talker rolls a critical result the target never realises they've been conned and accepts what the character says as the truth.
5. If the Fast Talker making the fast talk fails the roll, the target does not fall for their deception. They may try again, using a different argument, and they suffer a cumulative -20% modifier to their Influence each time they try. Until the character's modified Influence is 0 or below, they can keep on trying. At this point, the Fast Talker has lost all credibility with the target, who can simply ignore them and walk away.
6. If the Fast Talker fumbles their roll, the target immediately realises that they are the target of deception. Depending on the temperament of the target this may lead to them launching an attack (see moving to physical combat below), a loud denouncement of the Fast Talker or, at the very best, a loss of credibility (-20% with the Target on all Influence rolls until they succeed against them).

If timing is important, the whole exchange takes 1D6 minutes.

Note, the Fast Talker is usually the player character who is trying to convince a non-player character. There may be rare cases where the Fast Talker is a non-player character, run by the Referee, and the target is a character controlled by the player. Normally, this is someone who socially outranks the character in an organisation that they belong to and expects to be obeyed, such as high ranking Noble, Priest, Guild Master or Magus. The Referee should be careful when applying the outcome and should not corner the player character into a situation which the player is unhappy with. Even if the Fast Talker rolled a critical, the player character should be allowed to fail forward if they want to.

### Oratory

This is a type of public speaking, where a skilled speaker tries to convince an audience of their argument. Unlike Fast Talk, this is the art of influencing large crowds. This procedure applies to both formal public speaking, such as political debates or trials, or informal public speaking such as an argument between the players' adventuring group and a group of bandits.

The Orator puts forward their argument over a series of exchanges, which last ten minutes or more, to win over the audience. The Orator wins when all the audience comes over to their side or, if the combat has a time limit, if they have more members of the audience on their side.

#### Setup

Make a note of the size of the audience. As the Orator wins over the audience, members will come over to their side. Conversely, if there is a Defence Orator, they can win back the audience that the Orator is attempting to win over.

Determine how long the oratory will last. Public affairs either have a set time limit, based upon legal tradition, or can be big debates that last as long as it needs for one side to win.

The Referee determines if the audience has a Defending Orator. Normally, this is a non-player character. If you need to make up their stats on the spot, normally they will be a veteran in the Influence Skill (75%) and have a Persistence of about 50%.

#### Procedure

1. The Orator puts forward their argument, which the player controlling the Orator roleplays out.
2. They roll against their Influence, modified by the Referee (see Modifiers for Oratory below).
3. If the Orator succeeds, 1D10 members of the audience move over to their side of the argument.
4. If the Orator fails, the audience remains unconvinced, and the Orator is at -20% for their next attempt to sway the audience.
5. At this point, if there is a defending Orator (see 'Who the Orator?' below) in the audience, they get to respond. Repeat steps 3-5 for the defence.
6. Look at the state of the audience after the defence has spoken.
7. If all the audience is on the Orator's side, then they accept the Orator's argument and the Orator wins the combat.
8. If the combat is time-limited and the time limit is up, look at the numbers of the audience that have moved over to the Orator, and the number who remain unconvinced. If that number is in favour of the Orator, they win.
9. If at any point the Orator or the defence fumble their roll, they automatically lose ten audience members. If they have no audience members on their side, they lose the combat.
10. If at any point the Orator or the defence critical their roll, they automatically gain ten of the audience.
11. If neither side of the argument has won outright, and there is still time, the combat continues. Repeat the procedure.

#### Who is the Orator?

Normally the Orator will be the attacking player character, and the defence will be a named non-player character who acts as the leader for the audience.

Occasionally the Orator will be a non-player character. Still, it can be the other way round with the Orator being an NPC who outranks the character in much the same conditions as Fast Talk.

#### Modifiers for Oratory

The following conditions give a +20% bonus to the Orator's Influence. Apply only one.

- If the player gives a resoundingly good roleplaying performance when presenting the Orator's argument.
- If the Orator has another skill which will back up the argument they are putting forward.
- If the Orator has a motive that reinforces the argument they are making.
- If the audience the Orator is facing is sympathetic to the Orator's argument.
- The following conditions give a -20% penalty to the Orator's influence.
- The audience is actively hostile to the Orator's argument.
- The physical conditions are adverse, for example its raining heavily.

Pick one modifier to apply, no stacking.

### Intimidation

Where the character trying to persuade another non-player character, or group of characters, using the threat of physical force. This often happens as an action during physical combat, where the character tries to get the other side to surrender or flee. Intimidation may be directed at a single enemy or a group of enemies. It also can occur at the beginning of combat, where the Intimidator challenges their opponents to either surrender immediately or leave the field peacefully.

Procedure.

1. The Intimidator's player roleplays out the what the Intimidator is saying and announces what they want the successful outcome to be.
2. They make a skill test using Influence.
3. If the Intimidator succeeds, they convince the target(s).
4. If the Intimidator rolls a critical result, the target caves immediately, surrendering or fleeing (player's choice).
5. If the Intimidator making the Intimidation fails the roll, the target is not intimidated.
6. If the Intimidator fumbles their roll, the target immediately digs in and cannot be intimidated by the character for the rest of the Quest.

Modifiers for Intimidation.

- If the character's motive has a bearing on the Intimidation attempt, give the character a +20% bonus to their Intimidation attempt.
- If the target(s) have a higher Influence or Persistence than the Intimidator's Influence, apply a -20% penalty to the Intimidator's Influence.
- If the target(s) is more powerful than the Intimidator or is at full strength if the target is a group, then apply a -50% penalty.

Pick one modifier to apply, no stacking.

As in a Fast Talk contest, the Intimidator is usually a player character. Occasionally the Intimidator will be a non-player character, under much the same conditions as in a Fast Talk contest

Intimidation uses the Basic Skill Test rather than Opposed Skill Test for speed, because it is often used as part of physical combat, which is already heavy with dice rolls.

### Prolonged Social Combats

The above procedures, as written, assume that you are resolving small scale conflicts that are of the moment between two combatants put on the spot.

Longer involved social combats, such as political campaign or even the courtship phase of a romance, can be run using one of two methods, that is decided by the Referee after discussion with the players involved, depending on whether the situation is stressed or unstressed.

If the combat is a leisurely unstressed affair, where the opposition isn't putting up an active resistance, simply use the skill level of the 'attacker' to determine the level of a win after a duration determined, using common sense, by both the player and the Referee.

#### Procedure

1. Between them, the Referee and the player(s) involved agree on a timescale for the combat - the length of time that it will take place over and the number of exchanges that occur.
2. Within the combat, each exchange is a sub-combat, which could be any one of the social combat types. Resolve using the rules given above.
3. Some exchanges can be magical attacks or physical combats, or even mini-Quests, made up of magical, physical and social exchanges that occur as full adventures. But the number of these must not exceed half of the total of exchanges.
4. Critical successes score two points for the character, while fumbles take two points off the character's score.

At the end of the series of exchanges, the winner is the side who has won the most skill tests.

### Magic and Social Combat

Certain magic spells increase the character's Influence skill, such as the Personal Magic spells, Enhance (Influence) and Thunder's Voice (which positively modifies Influence in Intimidation tests, as well as boosting the range at which social combat can occur considerably). These spells must be in effect before the character engages in social combat.

### Moving onto Physical Combat if Things go Wrong

Targets who win the social combat against the player character may, if the Referee decides it makes sense given the situation and the personality of the target, explode into violence. Failed Intimidation attempts are more likely to result in violence than Fast Talk or Oratory. If they do, the incensed target has a +20% bonus to their first action, which is usually a Close Combat or Unarmed attack.

## Physical Combat

### How A Combat Plays Out

This section gives an overview of how combat works overall. The next section _The Combat Round_ gives a detailed explanation of specific combat actions and how combat works as an exchange of attacks.

Combat procedure:

1. _Work out who is involved in the combat._ The Referee works out who is on the player characters' side and who is involved in the hostile group attacking them.
2. _Work out encounter distance._ The Referee chooses how far away the hostile group is to the player characters, either at range or close.
3. _Surprise attacks._ Surprise may be a factor in the combat. Either the characters or the hostiles may ambush the other side, one side may sneak up on the other, or the characters may simply come upon their opponents suddenly.
4. _Can combat be avoided_? Can the characters run away, intimidate their opponents into giving up, or fast-talk their way out of fighting?
5. _FIGHT! Drop into combat rounds_.A single round has a duration of five seconds, giving 12 rounds in every minute. During a round, every character can perform one action. Combat rounds cycle through a set of steps outlined below.
6. _Take damage._ As a result of combat the character may take damage in the form of hit point loss.
7. _End the combat._ If the characters or their opponents all have 0 hit points or less, or have surrendered or have run away, the combat ends.

#### Work Out Who is Involved in the Combat

The characters will be on one side, with the other side being the hostile group they are fighting. The Referee manages the hostile non-player characters, so needs to be clear on who is in that group. Writing down the names and hit point totals of the hostile group is a good idea. Also, the players need to determine who is involved in the combat on their side. Some players might not want their characters to be involved in the combat. They might rule that their characters are not in the immediate area where the combat is occurring and are standing away in an adjacent area which is safe from even magical or ranged attacks. The Referee should rule whether this is the case or if they are involved in the combat because they cannot avoid it.

#### Encounter Distance and Engaging in Combat

Not all combats start with the two sides, the players, and their opponents, directly facing each other within a sword's reach. At the beginning of a combat, or potential combat, the Referee must determine which of the two distances is relevant.

- _Close distance_ is a range of two metres or less and is the distance at which a character can engage in either Close or Unarmed combat.
- _Ranged distance_ is a rangebeyond two metres up to double the range of the missile weapon a character is holding. It is the distance at which the character can engage in ranged combat. Ranged combat typically happens out in the open countryside, where groups of combatants can see each other coming over the horizon or emerging in the distance from old ruined buildings.

If the opponents are hidden, either though sneaking up on the characters or setting an ambush for them, move onto the Surprise Attacks section below.

#### Scouting Ahead

In a typical encounter, where the characters are moving through the wilderness or ruins, roll a basic Perception skill test for any characters who are ahead of the main party scouting. Modify the Perception skill, for the amount of cover that the opponents have, using the following table.

| Modifier | Opponents cover |
| --- | --- |
| +50% | All the opponents are in clear sight. |
| +20% | Some opponents are visible, such as perimeter guards. |
| -20% | The opponents are hiding in the undergrowth. |
| -50% | The opponents are hiding in very good cover such as ruins or woods. |

If any of the scouts succeed, they can spot the opposition and choose the encounter distance. If they roll a critical they know the exact numbers and positions of opponents that they can reasonably see. They can, if needed, take extra time to scout out the rest of the opponents and they may make another Perception test with a +20% modifier, ignoring any modifiers for cover.

If any of the scouts fail, they are spotted approaching at ranged distance by the opposition. If any of the scouts fumble, they are split off from the rest of the party and may be at close range at the Referee's discretion.

#### Surprise Attacks

There are three types of surprise attacks, all of which can happen at close or ranged range.

- _Ambushes_, where one side is hiding in cover awaiting their opponents.
- _Sneak Attacks_ where one side uses Deception to stealthily creep up on their opponents, catching them unaware.
- _Rush Attacks_ where one side charges from range looking to overwhelm their opponents before they realise what is going on. In the procedure below use Athletics if on foot, or Ride or Drive if mounted or in some sort of vehicle (such as a chariot), instead of Deception as the skill for the attackers.

#### Surprise Attack Procedure

1. Note that there can only be a surprise attack if the conditions for it exist, e.g. decent cover, such as undergrowth, for the ambushers to hide in for an ambush; or an unaware opponent undergoing a sneak or rush attack.
2. If it is the characters who are the unaware side, each player makes an opposed skill test using their character's Perception vs the highest Deception in the opposing side.
3. If the characters are performing the attack, each player makes an opposed skill test using the character's Deception vs the highest Perception in the opposing side.
4. When being attacked, if the character fails their Perception skill test, they are surprised for one combat round and are unable to do any combat actions except Parry or Dodge. If they fumble, they cannot even defend themselves. The encounter distance is determined by the attackers as a group and will usually be at Ranged distance.
5. If attacking, an opponent is unable to make any attacks and may only Dodge or Parry as defensive reactions. If the opponent fumbles the Perception test, they cannot even defend themselves. The encounter distance (Close or Ranged) is determined by the players individually for their characters.

Note, if the characters or their opponents are successful in their surprise attack, both sides are now engaged in combat.

#### Avoiding a Fight

If the characters are not a victim of a surprise attack (see above) they can do one of the following to avoid a fight completely:

- _Run away_. The characters can turn tail and flee as quickly as possible. If the opposition chooses not to, or cannot for any reason, give chase (they are guards on a castle wall, for whom it would take a good minute or so to climb down and are under orders not to desert their post, for example), the characters can get away without any further problems.
- If the characters move faster, because they are on a mount that moves quicker than a standard human or they are using magic which gives them superhuman speed, they can run away without any more problems. If they are chased by an opponent who has a comparable speed, then they make an opposed Athletics skill test. If they win, they escape. If they fail, their opponents have caught them and get +20% on their next action. If they fumble, not only do their opponents catch them but those caught suffer the effects of surprise and are only able to defend themselves in the first combat round.
- _Intimidation._ The characters can try to intimidate the opposition to surrender or leave the battleground. One character, usually the one with the greatest Influence, leads the attempt, with the rest of the group assisting them. See Social Combat above.
- _Fast Talking._ The characters can try to fast talk their way out of a confrontation. See Fast Talk in Social Combat above.

#### FIGHT! Drop into Combat Rounds

The combat round is a measure of game time equalling five seconds, during which a character can normally do one thing, such as swing a sword.

Each combat round follows the following procedure:

1. _Statement of intent._ Each player declares what their character is doing. The Referee declares what the non-player characters are doing if they are visible to the characters. Otherwise, they keep it secret until the non-player character(s) act.
2. _Choose skills and apply modifiers._ The players work out which skill the characters will use to complete their combat action, normally one of the three combat skills (Close, Ranged and Unarmed Combat). The Referee then determines if there are any situational modifiers. If the characters have any modifiers due to active magic, add these to the situational modifiers (see bellow ). Finally, each player should know what their modified skill value is. Likewise, the Referee should work out for the opposition what skills they are using and what modifiers apply.
3. _Determine order._ The Referee counts down from 100%, and characters and non-player characters act in highest skill order.
4. _Take action._ When it's the player's turn, they state what their character's action is. Then they make any skill tests to try and make the stated course of action successfully. If called for, opponents make dice rolls for defensive reactions (Parry or Dodge). If a combat action is successful, apply its effects right there and then.
5. _End of combat round._ Once all eligible characters have acted in the combat round, it is over. If there are characters still engaged in combat with enemies, another combat round begins.

#### Taking Damage

When a character successfully scores damage against a target, remove it from the target's hit points. Every weapon has a damage rating, listed in its entry on the character sheet. This rating is the amount of dice rolled when the weapon successfully hits a target. Add the attacker's Damage Modifier to all Close Combat weapons and Ranged weapons, except those that rely on a mechanism to provide the force to throw the missile (such as Crossbows).

Reduce damage by the armour point (AP) value, if any, of any armour the target wears, and then subtract the damage from their hit points.

There are two types of wounds.

_Minor wounds_, where the hit point total is still positive.

_Mortal wounds_, which are the result of injuries that reduce the character's hit points to zero or less.

#### Minor Wounds

As long as hit points are above zero, any damage taken is considered minor wounds, meaning superficial cuts, bruises, and exhaustion.

#### Mortal Wounds

When hit points are zero or below, any damage is life-threatening; for what happens then see Zero Hit Points below. Such wounds are considered mortal.

#### Healing Wounds

If the character is only suffering minor wounds, some magical spells, such as Heal (personal magic) instantly heal damage to hit points. The Healing skill, as described in Skills, also helps. Over time, minor wounds heal naturally.

A character who is mortally wounded will need to either be treated by another character with the Healing skill or by strong healing magic, before natural healing starts.

If using the Healing skill, the wounded character must first be stabilised by a successful skill test, and then undergo Surgery to treat the wound, which is another successful skill test using the right tools and conditions (see Healing in Skills)

Healing magic that is strong enough to heal mortal wounds is Heal at magnitude 6 (Personal Magic), Divine Heal (Divine Magic), or Treat Wounds (Sorcery).

A character with a mortal wound needs to be healed or stabilised immediately within the same combat round or by the end of the next combat round at the very latest. If healed the character will also regain consciousness on a successful Resilience skill test.

### Combat Actions

The actions a character may take when it is their turn to act are detailed here. A character can only choose one of the options below each round.

***Summary of Combat Actions***

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| All-Out Attack | Two attacks at -20%. Gives up the ability to defend for the round. |
| Athletic Attack | Roll once. Must pass versus both Athletics (which represents the move) and the combat skill which you are using to attack with. If you succeed, you automatically score a critical hit. If you fail, you automatically score a fumble. |
| Cast Spell | The spell takes effect when the character's turn comes up in the order of combat (as determined by Magic Casting skill).The spell is not cast if casting is interrupted and concentration lost. |
| Change Stance | May move from prone to standing and vice versa. |
| Charge | The character moves at a running pace from Ranged to Close distance, followed by a close combat attack with a +1D6 to damage. The character loses their defensive reaction in the round. |
| Close Combat Attack | Character attacks opponent with a weapon, testing vs Close Combat skill. If they are successful, then they inflict weapon damage plus damage modifier. |
| Delay | The character either waits until after another character's action or tries to interrupt it. |
| Disarming Attack | Attacking to disarm an opponent, which does no physical damage. |
| Fighting Retreat | The character disengages from combat. If opposed, either fight another round successfully or use Deception to escape the battle. |
| Great Attack | The character makes one attack at +20% and deals their maximum damage bonus if they hit. Weapon damage is rolled normally. The character gives up all defensive reactions for the round. |
| Intimidation | The character uses their Influence skill, to persuade foes to flee or surrender. |
| Ranged Combat Attack | Character attacks opponent with a weapon, tests vs Ranged Combat skill. If successful, then does weapon damage plus damage modifier. |
| Ready/Change Weapon | The character draws or loads a weapon, making it ready for combat. |
| Set Weapon | If the weapon can be set in advance of a charge, the user gains +20% to attack, before the charging character. |
| Shield Defence | The character does nothing except defend against attacks using a medium or large shield. Parries with the shield are +20%. The defender does not suffer the usual penalty for defending against multiple attacks. |
| Skill Use | The character uses a non-combat skill. |
| Escaping Sprint | The character moves at running speed out of close combat. May not attack and may only Dodge as a reaction. This action allows the character to move from Close to Ranged distance. |
| Unarmed Attack | The character can attack using a natural weapon, such a fist or claw, or grapple. |
| Whirling Dervish | While using a small shield the character does not suffer the usual penalty for defending against multiple attacks. |

### Close Combat Actions

_Close Combat Attack:_ This is the standard Close Combat attack. The character can make a single close combat attack. See below for details.

#### Making Close Combat Attacks

1. _Making the attack:_ To attack, the player simply rolls 1D100 and compares it to the character's Close Combat skill. This roll may have modifiers for a specific situation or special attack, such as a Great Attack.
2. If a character rolls equal to or lower than their Close Combat skill, they have hit their target if the target fails to defend.
3. If a character rolls greater than their Close Combat skill, they have missed their target.
4. _Target reaction:_ If the enemy chooses not to or cannot react against the attack, then this attack is unopposed. Move straight on to damage resolution below.
5. If the attack is opposed, the defender makes a Dodge or Parry (see Defensive Reactions).
6. _Damage resolution:_ If the attack is successful, roll damage. Each weapon has a damage score; add the attacker's damage modifier to determine the total damage.
7. _Armour reduces Damage:_ If the defender is armoured, then the armour will absorb some of this damage. Reduce the attack's damage by the armour points (AP) of the defender's armour.
8. _Damage application:_ Apply any remaining damage to the defender's hit points.

***Close Combat Situational Modifiers***

| Situation | Skill Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Target is helpless | Automatic Critical |
| Target is prone or attacked from behind | +20% |
| Attacking or defending while on higher ground or while riding an animal | +20% |
| Attacking or defending while prone | –20% |
| Attacking or defending while on unstable ground | –20% |
| Attacking or defending while underwater | –50% |
| Defending while on the lower ground or against a mounted foe | –20% |
| Fighting in partial darkness | –20% |
| Fighting in darkness | –50% |

#### Close Combat Options and Variations

These are non-standard close combat attack actions. A character may only make one of these types of attack in a combat round.

_All-out Attack:_ The attacker gives up all their defensive reactions for the round but gains a second Close Combat attack, which happens straight after the first attack. Both attacks are at -20% due to the loss of skill during this frenzied attack.

_Athletic Attack_: This combat action is where the character performs some sort of movement above and beyond the usual free move and then attacks at the end of it. A flying kick or swinging off a chandelier into combat, are examples of this form of attack. To make the attack, you roll the dice as normal. With this dice roll, you must pass a skill test versus both Athletics (which represents the move) and the combat skill which you are using to attack with. If you succeed at both, you automatically score a critical hit. If you fail at either, you automatically score a fumble. There is no middle ground since this attack is an especially risky manoeuvre.

_Disarming Attack:_ Resolve as the standard Close Combat Attack above, but if successful the attacker disarms the target, knocking either their weapon or shield out of their grip and sending it 1D6 metres away from them. The target may defend against this attack using any of the standard defensive reactions; Dodge represents them moving physically away from the attack's reach and Parry represents the target moving the weapon/shield out of the attacker's reach.

_Great Attack:_ An attack for those attackers using swords, axes or maces, where the attacker has enough room to wind up the weapon for a forceful blow. The character makes one attack at +20% and deals their maximum damage bonus if they hit. Weapon damage is rolled normally. The character gives up all defensive reactions for the round.

_Natural Weapon Attack:_ Natural weapons, such as the teeth and claws of monsters, count as close combat weapons and not Unarmed Attacks. The damage they deal is in the monster's description.

_Set Weapon:_ A character can spend their action fixing the shaft of a weapon, such as a spear or a polearm, in the ground, in anticipation of a charge from an opponent. When the charge comes, the character automatically gets an attack at +20% before the charging character gets their attack. If the character makes any other action or reaction before the charge, the weapon becomes 'unset'.

### Unarmed Combat Actions

The character can make a single Unarmed Combat Attack with the express intent of either Striking, Holding or Throwing their opponent.

#### Making Unarmed Combat Attacks

1. _Making the attack:_ The attacker declares their intent to either strike, hold or throw before making the attack. Roll against their Unarmed Combat skill to determine if the attack is successful.
2. _Target reaction:_ If successful, the opponent may use their Dodge or Close Combat parry as a reaction to avoid the attack or use Unarmed Combat as their Reaction.
3. _Resisting using Unarmed Combat:_ If they successfully use Unarmed Combat as a reaction, the opponent can either decide to avoid the attack OR if they haven't used their action this round, they may counter attack and immediately apply the effects of a strike, hold or throw on the Attacker.
4. _Damage resolution:_ If the opponent's reaction fails then the attacker may inflict one of the following effects on their opponent:

    - _Strike:_ The attacker inflicts their Unarmed Damage (usually Fist/Kick of 1D4 + damage modifier) minus any armour that their opponent is wearing.
    - _Hold:_ The held opponent may attempt to break free once per round as their action. Make an opposed Unarmed Combat roll to see if they escape. At the end of each round that the opponent is held, including the first, the attacker may inflict damage of 1D4 + damage modifier. Armour does not help
    - _Throw:_ The opponent is thrown 2 metres and suffers damage equal to the attacker's damage modifier. The grapple ends in this case.

### Ranged Combat Actions

_Ranged combat attack:_ The character can make a single ranged combat attack. As well as a normal attack, there are the following special attacks.

_Aim:_ Every round spent aiming adds a +20% bonus to the character's Ranged Combat skill, up to a maximum modified skill of 100%. This bonus only applies to the first attack the character makes with the weapon at the aimed target. A character can take no other action or reaction while aiming without losing the aim bonus. This action can overcome the reduction in Ranged Skill due to the weapon being used at double its range.

#### Throwing Close Combat Weapons

If a close combat weapon does not have a dual design as a thrown weapon, and is hurled at an enemy, then it has a range of 8m and suffers a penalty to the attack of -20%. Use the character's Ranged Combat skill to make the attack.

#### Using Ranged Weapons

All ranged attacks are handled in the same manner as close combat attacks, with the following exceptions:

_Charging:_ Ranged attacks may not be used by a character during a Charge (see Movement Combat Actions )

_Loading ranged weapons:_ Most ranged weapons only take single combat round to ready. Others take more than one combat round to reload. Consult the weapon's Rate of Fire on the character sheet.

_Range:_ Within the weapon's range the Attacker shoots without penalty. If the target is within double the weapon's range, the attacker's weapon skill is modified by -20%. Attacks cannot be made at a distance beyond twice/double the weapon's range.

_Dodging and parrying:_ The target may attempt to Parry or Dodge a hand-thrown ranged attack but may not normally Dodge or parry ranged missile weapons (such as Bow and Crossbow fire). Shield-carrying characters may attempt to parry hand-thrown missile weapons if the target is aware of the attack.

#### Cover

Cover affects both ranged and close combat attacks. For missile attacks, the defender benefits from the best of the shield modifiers in the table above and the cover modifiers below.

_Partial cover -20%._ For example, a low wall that leaves only head and torso exposed.

_Excellent cover -50%_. For example, defender on a castle wall, firing from protected battlements.

_Virtually total cover -75%._ For example, behind a castle wall with arrow slits for defenders to shot through.

***Ranged Attack Situational Modifiers***

| Situation | Skill Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| **Wind (1)** |
| High wind | –20% |
| Fierce wind | –50% |
| Hurricane | Attack automatically fails |
| **Target Movement (1)** |
| Target has moved 10m or more since the attacker's last Combat Action | –20% |
| Target has moved 30m or more since last Combat Round | –50% |
| **Target Visibility (1)** |
| Target obscured by smoke, mist or is in partial darkness | –20% |
| Target obscured by thick smoke, fog or is in darkness | –50% |
| Target is above SIZ 20 | +20% |
| **Target Condition (1)** |
| Target is helpless | +20% |
| Target prone | –20% |
| **Attacker Condition (2)** |
| Attacker is prone | –50% |
| Attacker is underwater (3) | –20% |
| The attacker is on unstable ground | –20% |
| Attacker is blinded | –50% |

1. Modifiers within these sections are not cumulative. However, modifiers from different sections are cumulative. Therefore, shooting at a target within a mist that has moved more than 10m since the attacker's last Combat Action imparts a –50% penalty.

2. Attacker condition modifiers are cumulative.

3. Only thrown weapons may be used underwater. Bows and other projectile weapons will automatically miss if fired underwater.

#### Firing into a Crowd

When firing into a crowd, the Referee will determine how much cover the target has from the ranged attack. The Attacker then makes a ranged attack modified by the target's cover.

If the attack fails to hit the target and succeeds against an unmodified attack skill, the attacker has hit one of the individuals adjacent to the target (chosen by the Referee). The accidental target may Dodge against this attack as usual.

### Movement Combat Actions

In any combat round, a character may move a distance up to their movement rate without it counting as a separate combat action, which allows them to move about and change opponents quite freely.

All movement combat actions use Athletics Skill to determine combat order.

The following types of movement are combat actions.

_Change Stance:_ The character may stand up from prone, or vice versa.

_Charge:_ When the character closes in combat, from ranged to close distance at a sprint. The charge must be in a straight line and the Attacker must end up adjacent to an enemy. When the move is complete, make a Close Combat attack. If the attack is successful, the Attacker gains a bonus of +1D6 damage. Characters may not charge uphill and gain the damage bonus.

_Fighting Retreat:_ A character may move their full movement directly away from an enemy they are fighting. They may only defend, but at +20% to their close combat or unarmed combat. The modifier increases to +50% if the character is using a Large shield.

At the end of the round, if they have successfully defended themselves, they may disengage from combat. Otherwise, their opponent has moved with them and has successfully held them in combat.

_Escaping Sprint:_ The character runs out of combat range (from either close distance or ranged distance), forsaking their attack and only being able to Dodge as a defensive reaction. If running away from combat, if they successfully Dodge any incoming attack, at the end of the combat round they have disengaged from combat. Otherwise, their opponent has moved with them and has successfully held them in combat.

### Other Actions

_Cast Spell:_ Spells take effect in an order determined by the caster's Magic Casting skill.

_Delay:_ A character may pause to assess the tactical situation around them.

If a delaying character merely wishes to act after a specific character has acted, they wait until that character has finished their combat action.

If a delaying character wishes to interrupt a specific character's action as it occurs, the character must make an opposed test appropriate to their interrupting action (a weapon skill test if the character wishes to attack, for instance). Whoever wins the test acts first.

_Intimidate:_ The character tries to get the other side to surrender or flee, directed at a single enemy or a group. The rules are covered above in the section on Social Combat.

_Ready/Change Weapons:_ If the character has their weapon ready at the start of the combat they can use it straight away. If the character changes weapons, e.g. from a bow to a sword, it takes one combat round. If parrying a Close Combat attack while changing weapons, the character may do so at -20%. They may Dodge without this penalty.

_Skill Use:_ The character performs one action which requires the use of a skill, such as opening a locked door with the Mechanisms skill.

### Defensive Reactions

Reactions happen after a successful attack has occurred, but before its effects are applied.

There are two types of reaction, Dodge and Parry.

_Parries_ can be made against Close Combat attacks using Close Combat skill or Unarmed Combat Skill.

Shields can also parry missile attacks, as outlined in 'Using Shields Against Ranged Attacks' in Special Combat Rules.

_Dodges_ can be made against close combat attacks and thrown missile weapons, providing the target is aware of the attack. Dodge can also be used as a reaction, if still available, to avoid the damage of spells, such as Lightning Strike, projected at the Defender. See the appropriate spell descriptions in the Magic chapter for more detail.

#### Dodge

When an attacker successfully hits, the defender may choose to Dodge as their reaction, to avoid damage.

##### Procedure

1. The defender rolls against their Dodge skill.
2. If the defender succeeds, then they have successfully avoided the attack.
3. If they fail, they take damage as normal.
4. If they fumble, they take maximum damage from the attack.
5. If dodging against a critical hit, then if the defender rolls a critical on their Dodge, they reduce the attacker's critical to a normal success. If the defender fails their Dodge against a critical hit, the attacker does maximum damage and ignores defender's armour.

#### Parry

When an attacker successfully hits, the defender may choose to parry with a weapon or shield as their reaction to avoid damage.

##### Procedure

1. The defender rolls against their Close Combat skill.
2. If the defender succeeds, then they block all rolled damage
3. A critical parry against a normal success deflects all the damage and causes the attacker to suffer a fumble. If when parrying against a critical hit, the defender rolls a critical on their Close Combat skill roll, then they reduce the attacker's critical success to a normal success.

#### Multiple Defences in a Single Combat Round

You can defend as many times as you want, but you get a cumulative -20% modifier for every defence after the first.

### Special Results

#### Critical Hits

Critical hits represent a lucky and effective hit in an unprotected area of an opponent.

If the skill test is a success and both dice (units and tens) are the same value, it is a critical hit.

A critical hit automatically causes maximum damage for the weapon and maximum damage modifier. Critical hits also ignore armour.

A critical hit is made a normal hit by a critical parry or critical Dodge. Then damage is rolled by the attacker as normal and the defender's armour counts.

#### Fumbles

Conversely, if an attacker or defender fumbles, the character has been put at a severe disadvantage. It is up to the Referee to determine how, dependent on the situation. Here are some examples.

- Grievously hurt self or a nearby friend with a weapon. Roll damage and ignore armour.
- Trip over and fall prone.
- The character becomes confused and misses one combat round.
- Armour or shield strap breaks; lose armour protection.

Summary of Combat Results

| Attacker's Combat Action | Defender's Reaction | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fumble | No need to roll | Attacker fumbles. |
| Failure | No need to roll | Attacker fails to hit the defender. |
| Success | Fumble | Attacker hits, then the defender takes damage rolled minus armour points and fumbles. |
| Success | Failure | Attacker hits, the defender takes damage rolled minus armour points. Note, this is the standard result if the defender decides not to or cannot defend themself. |
| Success | Success | If the Defender is dodging, they avoid the attack. If parrying, they parry the attack. |
| Success | Critical | Defender avoids the attack and takes no damage. |
| Critical | Fumble | The Attacker does maximum damage and ignores the Defender's armour. The Defender fumbles. |
| Critical | Failure | The Attacker does maximum damage and ignores the Defender's armour. |
| Critical | Success | The Attacker does maximum damage and ignores the Defender's armour. |
| Critical | Critical | Attacker hits, the defender takes damage rolled minus armour points. |

### Special Combat Rules

#### Mounted Combat

A mounted warrior has a +20% bonus to their attacks and parries against adjacent opponents on foot; a character on foot defending against a mounted attacker suffers a –20% penalty to their Reaction skill. These modifiers do not apply if the target on foot is as tall as the mounted character is while mounted.

A mounted character uses their mount's Movement Rate when moving rather than their own.

A mounted adventurer can use no weapon at a skill level greater than their Riding skill score.

_Untrained Mounts_

The rider of a mount which is unused to combat must make a Riding Skill test at the start of each Combat Round.

Failing this test will cause the mount to automatically use the Flee Combat Action at the first opportunity for the remainder of the Combat Round.

Succeeding this test allows the mount to act as if battle trained for the remainder of the Combat Round.

#### Two-Weapon Use

A character wielding two weapons or a weapon and a shield may use the off-hand item to either:

Parry one additional attack per Combat Round without any penalty (after this extra parry the cumulative -20% penalty per additional attack parried applies).

OR

Gain a single bonus Close Combat Attack action. This bonus attack is at -20% Close Combat skill. The second attack occurs at half the character's skill in order of combat. Also, this may only be a normal Close Combat Attack, not an All-Out Attack, Disarming Attack or a Great Attack.

For example, a warrior armed with sword and shield, can attack with the sword normally and then follow this up immediately with a shield bash at -20% to the shield attack.

#### Shield Use

Shields are a special type of combat equipment, whose obvious use is as a moveable piece of armour to parry close combat attacks, but which can also be used to make attacks and block ranged attacks. This section explains their many uses.

#### Using Shields to Parry Close Combat Attacks

This is the most common use of shields.

#### Using Shields to Perform an Attack

Shields can also be used to attack, either on their own as a standard attack to do what is called a shield bash, or with a one-handed weapon to perform a multiple weapon attack .

#### Using Shields Against Ranged Attacks

Shields can defend against Ranged Attacks, if their users are aware of the attack, in two ways.

_Parrying Thrown Missiles._ Medium and large shields can parry incoming thrown ranged weapons, such as spears.

_As Cover against Missiles._ Medium and large shields provide cover against missile attacks when set against them. The defender sets their shield against the onslaught of missile fire, delaying their action until the missiles have stopped firing. Medium shields give a -20% penalty to incoming Ranged Attacks, while large shields give a -50% penalty due to cover.

#### Using Large Shields during a Fighting Retreat

Large Shields give a +50% modifier to the Close Combat skill of character using this Movement Action

#### Shield Combat Actions

_Whirling Dervish (Small)._ You can attack with a 1-Handed weapon and defend with your small sized shield, without the normal cumulative -20% penalty for multiple defences, since the combination of weapon and shield is light and maneuverable.

_Shield Defence (Medium/Large)._ Your combat action is to use your shield in defence for the entire combat round. As a result, you get a +20% modifier to all parries using your shield. On a critical success, you get an automatic counterstrike against your opponent doing your weapons for normal damage. You also do not suffer the cumulative -20% penalty for defending against multiple attacks.

***Using Shields, a Summary***

| Size of Shield | Damage | Missile Cover | Combat Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small (Buckler) | 1D4 | None | Parry Close Combat attacks, Close Combat attack, Whirling Dervish |
| Medium (Target) | 1D6 | -20% | Parry Close Combat attacks, Close Combat attack, Parry Thrown Missiles, Cover against missile attacks, Shield Defence. |
| Large (Kite, Viking Round) | 1D8 | -50% | Parry Close Combat attacks, Close Combat attack, Parry Thrown Missiles, Cover against missile attacks, +50% during Fighting Retreat, Shield Defence. |

### Ending the Combat

There are three common ways combat can end.

1. Disengaging from Combat
2. Zero Hit Points
3. Surrendering

#### Disengaging from Combat

If a player announces that they want to escape combat, the attempt might be Unopposed or Opposed, depending on the situation.

_Unopposed escape._ If the character is unopposed, usually because no one is watching them and they are not fighting someone, then they can just up and leave, using a standard move or sprint to do so. Of course, the character can't do anything to bring attention to themselves during the retreat, such as cast a spell or make an attack.

_Escape is opposed._ If the character is still in combat or has someone ready within range to engage them in combat, it is less easy to get away. The Referee should work out what sort of skill test is required to get the character out of harm's way. If stealth or deception is involved, a Deception test is the order of the day, and a good description from the player is required. If the character is attempting to fight their way out of combat, use the Fighting Retreat action (see Movement Combat Actions below), where the character fights one more round of combat and, if successful, escapes the combat. Or the character can use an Escaping Sprint action to move out of combat and Dodge any attacks that come their way (see 'Escaping Sprint' in Movement Combat Actions below).

#### Zero Hit Points

When a character is at zero or fewer hit points, they aredead.

Unless one of the following happens.

- The player or Referee controlling the character who inflicted the killing blow says that their last blow was non-lethal, which allows them to take their opponent prisoner.
- The player spends a fortune point to have their character avoid death and awake 1D6 hours later with one hit point.
- Another character heals the wounded character using magic, or stablises them using the Healing skill, by the end of the next round after the one which they reach zero hit points.

#### Surrendering

The character may simply give up and try to surrender to their opponents.

It is up to the Referee to determine whether the opponents allow the character to surrender. Most intelligent opponents will capture wealthy-seeming characters and extract a significant ransom that leaves the character significantly poorer. If using the Wealth optional rules, the ransom reduces a character's Wealth skill by 1d20. However, if the character has brutally murdered members of their group, the survivors may be less willing to let the character surrender.

Opponents that are psychotic or are currently under the influence of a Berserk spell will not accept a surrender and will continue to attack.

Opponents who hate the character's culture will accept the character's surrender only on a successful Influence skill test OR if the opponent has been told by a superior to capture the character.

## Magical Combat

Unless both sides in combat are using magic exclusively, magical combat usually happens within physical or social combat. The precise effects of magical spells are in the magic chapters, but you should be aware of the types of magic that are available that play a role in combat.

_Offensive_ magic can take the form of spells that add to the chances of success and damage that the character does in combat, such as the weapon enhancing spell Weapon Enhance, or that perform a direct magical attack on the target upon success, such as the spells Fear, Disruption or Sky Bolt.

_Defensive_ magic either increases the character's armour or chance to avoid harm, such as Protection which increases the characters armour points, or gives the character the ability to resist or ignore both physical and magical attacks, such as Countermagic.

There is a special type of magical combat, known as _Spirit Combat_ which is detailed below.

### Resisting Spells

Most offensive spells have the Resist trait, followed by the Resistance skill in brackets (which is used in a Skill Test to fully or partially avoid the effects of the spell). See the particular spell description for full details.

### Spirit Combat

Not all spirits in the spirit world are friendly to the player characters. Some are guardian spirits placed over treasures and locations to guard them against intruders who they will attack when they enter their area.

Others are hostile spirits, unleashed in combat by enemy shamans. And some are malignant entities that a shaman encounters in their travels in the spirit world looking for beneficial spirits.

In such cases, spirit combat occurs. This takes the form of a clash of spiritual energies, each trying to overcome and dominate the other.

#### Procedure

1. Resolve spirit combat using an opposed skill test.
2. If also part of physical combat, then spirit combat occurs instantaneously in real-time. Resolve the spirit combat in its entirety before continuing with the rest of the combat round.
3. Use the spirit's Spirit Combat skill as given in its description.
4. Player characters use either Persistence, if they are untrained in the ways of Shamans, or the Shamanism skill, which is available to characters who have qualified as Shamans (see Personal Magic, Shamanism)
5. The combatant who loses the spirit combat test loses 1D6 magic points, minus the magnitude of any Spirit Shield or similar protective magic they may have cast upon them.
6. The more powerful a spirit is, the more damage it does. For every ten points of POW above 20 a spirit combatant gains an extra +1D6 to the damage they do in spirit combat.
7. If a combatant's magic points are 0 or less, it loses the combat. If the opponent was using Persistence, the spirit is banished and flees into the depths of the Spirit World. If the victor was using a Shamanism skill and knows the appropriate Call spell for the spirit, then they may bind the spirit to their service for one action right there and then, or spend one improvement point either then or at the end of the gaming session to bind it into more permanent service. If the loser is a mortal with a body, and the winner is a spirit capable of possession, the loser becomes possessed by the spirit.

#### Spirit Possession

Possession is when a spirit steals or inhabits a physical body for its ends. All forms of possessing spirits can be driven out by the divine magic spell Exorcism, the Personal Magic spell Drive Out Spirits, or similar magic. There are two types of possession:

#### Covert

This type of possession has the spirit hiding in the victim's body. It only assumes partial control of the victim when it needs to do something to the victim's body. A form of possession typically used by most Spirits.

#### Dominant

The spirit takes full control of the victim's body and, in turn, the victim's spirit is imprisoned in the body, unable to do anything until the hostile spirit is exorcised or leaves. A most dangerous form of possession, as the spirit often cares nothing for the body it inhabits, for once the body dies the spirit returns to its old existence, in most cases, and possession by a suicidal ghost or homicidal demon is never good for the body in question.

# OQ3 SRD Spot Rules

This selection of rules deals with individual situations that may crop up throughout the game.

## Travel

Characters travel at their Movement Rate in kilometers daily assuming a eight hour day of travelling, so Humans travel 15 kilometers a day, while horses can travel 30 kilometers.

Characters travelling off road, through difficult terrain and conditions may at the Referee's discretion face a Natural Lore skill test, to maintain the normal movement rate. If they fail cut the daily move by half. If they fumble they face some sort of danger as determined by the Referee, a dangerous animal or a environmental hazard, or simply are lost and make no progress that day.

If you are using the Encumbrance rules characters who are overloaded, move at half that amount.

Referees may optionally make a fatigue test if the terrain or conditions were particularly taxing. For example if the characters travel along a well maintained road with places to stop and rest, with food and water, then there is no need to make a test, while at the other end of the spectrum if the characters where hiking through rough hilly terrain with no comfort breaks under a particularly harsh sun the Referee can call for a Hard (-20%) or even Impossible (-50%) fatigue test at the end of the day's travel.

If you need to determine which of two groups of comparable movement rate reached a destination first, precisely, use an opposed Athletics (for walking characters) or Riding test (for mounted characters).

## Illumination and Darkness

***Illuminating Items***

| Example | Radius |
| --- | --- |
| Candle or embers | 1 m |
| Flaming brand or lantern | 3 m |
| Campfire | 5 m |
| Bonfire | 10 m |
| Light spell | 10 m but, unlike natural light sources, the Light spell only illuminates a 10 m radius and does not provide partial darkness or darkness to areas beyond this radius. |

### Dark Sight

This ability allows the character to treat pitch-black conditions as if dark. It is normally possessed by subterranean or darkness aligned creatures.

### **Night Sight**

This ability allows the character to treat partial darkness as illuminated and darkness as only partial darkness. Nocturnal creatures normally possess this.

### Illumination and Darkness Effects

The following table gives the effects of various types of illumination and darkness on the characters.

***Illumination Effects***

| Environment is | Effects |
| --- | --- |
| Brightly Illuminated | None. |
| Illuminated | None. |
| Partial Darkness | –20% to vision-based Perception tests. |
| Dark | -50% to vision-based Perception tests. Movement Rate halved. |
| Pitch Black | Perception tests reliant on vision become near impossible, as are ranged attacks. Close combat attacks are at -50%. Movement rate a quarter of normal. |

## Fatigue

Combat, sprinting, climbing, and swimming against a strong current, are all examples of when a character can become fatigued and tired.

If the Referee rules that a character has been doing an activity that may have drained them of physical energy, then they may call for a Resilience roll. If the character fails the roll, they suffer the effects of Fatigue (see below).

This test happens after the activity is complete, unless the activity is long and drawn out, and there is a real danger that Fatigue will stop the task. For example, on a long hard march, the characters are pressing on ahead so that they can reach a fort before an enemy army arrives there. In this case, there is a real danger that they will arrive not only too late but tired and worn down.

### The Effects of Fatigue

If a character fails the Resilience test, then they become fatigued. All skill tests are at -20%. Also, movement rate drops by a quarter. The character also becomes sluggish, DEX and INT are each reduced by three points.

If the fatigued character insists on engaging in heavy activity, such as combat, heavy labour or running, then another Resilience roll is made at -20%. If the character fails this second skill test, fatigue level becomes heavily fatigued, with the above penalties increased to -50%.

If a character fumbles any of their Resilience rolls, then they immediately fall unconscious for 3D6 minutes and upon waking are still fatigued.

### Recovering from Fatigue

A character who completely rests for 20-CON hours will remove the effects of any Fatigue.

A Vigour spell (see Personal Magic) will also remove the effects of Fatigue.

### **Exposure, Starvation and Thirst**

A character can normally survive for several hours equal to their CON before suffering from exposure.

A character can survive for several days equal to their CON before becoming starved, though after three days they will begin to suffer a –20% penalty to Fatigue tests.

A character can survive for a number of hours equal to their CON x 2 before becoming chronically thirsty, though particularly arid environments may reduce this to CON x 1 or even CON x ½. Whenever a character is suffering from exposure, starvation or thirst, the Fatigue test penalty immediately changes to –20%. Also, the character will automatically suffer D6 damage every day, for every condition they are experiencing. Natural or magical healing will not heal this damage – only sufficient shelter, food or water can remedy the problem and allow natural or magical healing to take place.

## Healing

Healing can be performed in one of three ways – using the Healing skill, a magical spell, or through natural healing, resting while the injuries heal themselves.

### **Natural Healing**

A character's Minor injuries regain CON/4 (round up) hit points per 24 hours, as long as the character does not engage in anything more than light activity.

Mortal wounds do not naturally heal, see the section below for more details.

### **Magical Healing**

However magical healing is achieved, whether from a spell, prayer or potion, it has an instantaneous effect.

Unless specifically stated, magical healing cannot re-attach severed limbs or revive the dead.

### **Mortal Wounds**

Mortal wounds are those that reduce the character's hit points to zero or below.

Mortal wounds do not heal naturally on their own and require intervention from a character using the Healing skill or magical healing spells such as Heal at magnitude 6 (see Personal Magic), the Divine Magic spell Divine Heal, or the Sorcery spell Treat Wounds.

In addition to the restoration of hit points, any characters suffering a Mortal Wound that receive even a single hit point restoration through magical healing will immediately stop bleeding and will heal naturally. The character will also regain consciousness on a successful Resilience skill test.

## Encumbrance

Every piece of equipment in the Equipment chapter has an Encumbrance (ENC) score, apart from those items that are too small or light. Characters can usually ignore the effects on Encumbrance that these light items have until they start to carry a lot of them – assume that an average of 20 such items will equal 1 ENC, on the basis that the character has a suitable means of carrying them, such as a sack or backpack.

A character can carry equipment which has a total ENC of less than or equal to their STR+SIZ without penalty.

Encumbrance is a measure of not only weight but also the bulk of the item, reflecting the awkwardness of handling the item. Roughly 1 ENC is equal to 1/4 of a SIZ point.

### **Overloading**

A character carrying total ENC greater than their STR+SIZ is Overloaded.

Overloaded characters suffer a –20% penalty to all tests that require physical actions, including Weapon skill tests and most tests that have DEX or STR as a Characteristic.

Overloaded characters have their Movement halved. They also suffer a –20% penalty to all Fatigue tests.

A character cannot carry more than twice their STR+SIZ in ENC.

## Falling

A character that takes damage from a fall ends up prone. Armour points do not reduce falling damage.

A character takes 1D6 damage per metre fallen, after the first.

As long as the character was not surprised, they may attempt an Athletics test to mitigate falling damage. A successful test allows the character to treat the fall as if it were two metres shorter than it is. Also, as long as this test is a success and the character's hit points are not zero or less due to the fall, the character lands safely and is not prone. If the roll is a critical then miraculously no damage is taken. If the roll is a fumble, then the maximum possible damage is taken.

Characters falling onto soft surfaces may have the distance they fall effectively halved for damage.

## Suffocation

While underwater or moving through a poison gas cloud, a character can hold their breath for a number of Combat Rounds equal to their CON.

Once a character has surpassed the time for which they can hold their breath, they must make a Resilience test every round with a cumulative –10% penalty. On a failed roll, the character automatically starts inhaling the suffocating substance.

***Suffocating Substances***

| Substance Inhaled | Damage Taken |
| --- | --- |
| Water | 2D6 |
| Vacuum | 2D6 |
| Thick Smoke | 1D6 |
| Poison Gas | A character suffers poison exposure. If the gas is also a thick smoke, then 1D6 damage is incurred in addition to the poison's effect. |

Armour points do not reduce suffocation damage. The damage will only cease once the character can draw breathable air once more. Even then, the character will require a Resilience test to be able to do anything other than wretch or gasp for breath for 1D4 combat rounds.

## Burning

The amount of damage per combat round suffered from fire or heat will depend on its intensity, as shown on the Fire and Heat table. Metal armour, such as plate or chain mail, does not subtract from the rolled damage.

***Fire and Heat Effects***

| Source | Example | Damage/round |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flame | Candle | 1 point |
| Large Flame | Flaming brand | 1D4 |
| Small Fire | Campfire, cooking fire | 1D6 |
| Large Fire | Scolding steam, large bonfires, burning rooms | 2D6 |
| Inferno | Lava, inside a blast furnace | 3D6 |

## Poison

Plants and creatures have developed poisons as a method of protecting themselves against predators. They are also used by assassins and wrongdoers of all kinds to murder their victims.

Every type of poison has the following information detailed:

_Name:_ The poison's name. Also, if the poison is magical, it will be mentioned here.

_Type:_ Lists whether the poison is ingested, used on a weapon or inhaled.

_Delay:_ The time between the poison's introduction to a character, to the time its effect takes hold.

_Potency:_ This is a number between 10 and 100 that measures the strength of a poison. Some magical poisons, like Basilisk Venom, have even higher Potencies. A character must make an opposed Resilience test versus the poison's Potency test to avoid or mitigate the damage of the poison.

_Effect:_ Usually hit point damage, though this is not universal. Some poisons cause a character to sleep for some time. More exotic poisons may cause hallucinogenic effects, paralysis or a combination of effects. These take place after the delay noted above.

_Duration:_ How long the poison, if effective, will affect the victim. The effects of the poison cannot be removed or healed until the poison itself has been neutralised or has dissipated in the victim's system.

### Poison Succeeds, Character Fails

If the poison succeeds its Potency test, and the character fails their Resilience test, the poison has its full effect.

### Character Succeeds, Poison Fails

If the character succeeds their Resilience test and the poison fails its Potency test, the poison does not affect.

### Both Poison and Character Succeed

Whoever rolled the highest in their test wins.

### Both Poison and Character Fail

Whoever rolled the lowest in their test wins.

Here is an example of poison, that of the fearsome snake-haired Gorgon.

#### Gorgon Serpent Venom

_Type:_ Ingested or smeared

_Delay:_ 1D3 Combat Rounds

_Potency:_ 34

_Full Effect:_ 1D3 hit point damage and applies –3 penalty to victim's CON

_Duration:_ 6D10 minutes

## Disease

Disease is a source of threat in fantasy worlds, either from fantastic diseases that ravage the land from time to time or those caused by Disease Spirits.

Every type of disease has the following information detailed:

_Name:_ The disease's name. Also, if the disease is magical, it will be mentioned here.

_Type:_ Lists whether the disease is spread through contamination, touch or is airborne.

_Delay:_ The time between the disease's introduction to a character, to the time its effect takes hold. It is also the time following disease contraction that a victim will make follow-up opposed disease tests.

_Potency:_ This is a number between 10 and 100 that measures the strength of a disease. Some magical diseases, like the shining plague, have even higher Potencies. A character must make an opposed Resilience test versus the disease's Potency test to avoid or mitigate the damage of the disease.

_Effect:_ Usually hit point damage, though this is not universal. Many diseases will apply a penalty to Characteristics or skills. More exotic diseases may cause hallucinogenic effects, paralysis or a combination of effects. These take place after the delay noted above.

The effects of the disease cannot be removed or healed until the disease itself has been neutralised or has dissipated in the victim's system.

### Disease Succeeds, Character Fails

If the disease succeeds its Potency test, and the character fails their Resilience test, the disease has its full effect.

### Character Succeeds, Disease Fails

If the character succeeds their Resilience test, and the disease fails its Potency test, the disease does not affect the character.

### Both Disease and Character Succeed

Whoever rolled the highest in their test wins.

Both Disease and Character Fail

Whoever rolled the lowest in their test wins.

Unlike a poison, diseases will progress if a character does not resist its effects. Once the victim fails the first opposed test, they will have to make an additional opposed test (after an amount of time determined by the disease's delay statistic).

If the victim succeeds this second opposed test, they have overcome the worst of the disease and will no longer suffer its effects, other than remaining hit point damage, after a while. Use the disease's delay statistic to determine how long this takes.

If the victim fails this second opposed test, they fall deeper into the disease. Apply all of the disease's effects again to the character. Once the delay period has elapsed once more, the victim will have to make a third opposed disease test, and so on.

Here are two examples of diseases, one a normal mundane disease and one that is magical.

### Example Disease

_Name:_ The Shakes

_Type:_ Touch

_Delay:_ 1-2 days

_Potency:_ 50

_Effect:_ This flu-like disease renders its victims in a cold and constantly shaking state, during which DEX halved. Also, for each day that the victim suffers from the Shakes, they take 1D6 hit points of damage.

## Breaking Inanimate Objects

Sometimes a character will want to break an inanimate object, such as when a locked door needs to be forced open by breaking through the wood.

Simply make an Athletics test, since this skill covers brute force, modified by the difficulty of the task at hand. In the case of the door, there is no modification if the door is a standard door made of wood, but it becomes hard if its reinforced, and even impossible if it is made of stone. If the wood is rotten the Referee may make the roll easy or even not require a test. Some objects may not be broken, unless the character is under the effects of magic that plausibly increases their strength to the level where breaking the object is possible.

## Ships and Sailing

### Construction

There are three types of sailing ship: sloops (small, fast, but comparatively fragile one-masted vessels), brigs (fast and manoeuvrable two-masted vessels), and ships (larger vessels with at least three masts, whether warships or cargo vessels).

Weapons are handled abstractly; ship-mounted weapons are not accurate, and large numbers of shots have to be fired to have a chance to hit an enemy ship. Thus, a ship's weapons are rated abstractly as a single percentage chance to hit an enemy vessel in combat; almost certainly many weapons are fired for each "hit roll". A hit generally does 1D8 damage, subtracted from the other ship's structure points.

Every 10% in weapons reduces cargo capacity by 2 tons and means two extra crew are needed. The weapons level cannot go above 100%.

Even beyond weapons carried, not all ships are identical; any ship will have one of the following special features. It might have more than one such feature; in this case, add +50% of the original cost to the total cost per feature added.

_Armoured:_ AP 2 against any attacks.

_Fast:_ Add +1 knot to speed.

_Heavy Weapons:_ Hits from weapons do D12 rather than D8 damage.

_High Capacity:_ Increase cargo size by +50%.

_Manoeuvrable:_ Add +20% to sailing tests (see below).

_Marines:_ The ship can carry (and provide board and lodging for) marines equal to the size of its crew.

_Ram:_ The ship can ram other vessels in combat without suffering damage.

_Skeleton Crew:_ The crew size needed to run the ship (as indicated in the above table) at half strength.

***Types of Ship***

| Type of Ship | Crew | Cost (SP) | Maneuverability | Speed | Structure Points | Cargo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One-masted | 10 | 5000 | +20% | 6 Knots | 20 | 8 Tons |
| Two-masted | 20 | 15000 | - | 5 Knots | 40 | 15 Tons |
| Three-masted | 30 | 50000 | -20% | 4 Knots | 60 | 30 Tons |

### Sailing Tests

Most potential manoeuvres a vessel can make use the captain's Sailing skill, modified by the manoeuvrability of the vessel. A further modifier is the average Sailing skill level of the crew. In this case these two modifiers do add together.

***Sailing Modifiers***

| The average Sailing skill of the crew | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| 20% or less (no idea) | -20% penalty |
| 26%-50% (competent) | No modifier |
| 51%-75% (veteran) | +20% bonus |
| 76% or more (expert) | +50% bonus |

### Travel

In normal sailing conditions, a sailing vessel can move 20 miles per day per knot of speed. Speeds given are averages. Very favourable conditions – for example, a good strong wind in the desired direction of travel (possibly magically arranged) – can double these speeds. As can a rowing crew who critical their Sailing skill test.

On the other hand, if a ship is becalmed, with no wind at all, it cannot move.

Every day out of sight of land, there is a 5% chance of a storm. Storms do 2D6 structure points of damage to a ship; a ship reduced to zero structure points begins to sink (and will sink almost instantly if its structure points fall to the negative of the original amount). Further, sailors on deck must make Dodge tests to stay on board; a sailor swept overboard and not immediately rescued must make an Athletics test to survive.

Fortunately, the captain can make a Sailing test (modified by manoeuvrability) to halve damage from a storm. Better yet, it is possible to plot a course to avoid an incoming storm if it is detected in time (perhaps using magic or skills such as Natural Lore).

### Naval Combat

We consider two ranges of distance between ships. Contact or Combat Range.

#### Contact

The vessels can see each other. If both vessels wish to close to combat range or leave the contact, this action is, of course, automatic, and takes about an hour. If the vessels want different things, roll opposed Sailing tests, as above.

#### Combat Range

Combat between ships is similar to normal combat. Initiative is decided for each ship, rather than between individuals, Use the Captain's Sailing Skill, modified by the manoeuvrability of the vessel, to determine initiative for the ship.

Roll a single skill test to fire a ship's weapons with no defence roll allowed. If desired, a character can be appointed weapons officer; they oversee the firing of a ship's weapons. That character should make a Ranged Combat skill test; if the test succeeds, the ship's weapons test has a +20% bonus.

Hand-held weapons are too small to have any effect on an opposing ship. Against those on the decks they're another matter. Fire is the exception to this rule, being used to set flammable objects, such as decks and sails, on fire.

The following special manoeuvres can be made by a ship in combat range. One manoeuvre is allowed per round. Each manoeuvre needs a Sailing skill test by the captain, as indicated above.

_Broadside._ If the skill test succeeds, two attacks with a ship's weapons can be made instead of one.

_Evade._ If the Sailing test succeeds, the opponent cannot use the broadside, ram, or boarding manoeuvres. Further, the vessel can escape combat range (out to contact range) if the other vessel allows it or the Sailing test succeeds as an opposed roll.

_Ram._ The other vessel is rammed if an opposed Sailing test succeeds. A ramming attack does D6 points of damage per mast. If the ship performing this manoeuvre lacks a battering ram, it also takes half the damage inflicted.

_Boarding._ Boarding is possible if an opposed Sailing test succeeds. In this case, the vessels are roped together, and boarding can commence. A free Sailing test for boarding is allowed immediately after a successful ramming manoeuvre if desired. If both vessels want to board the other, this is automatic.

# OQ3 SRD Personal Magic

## Magic Points

All characters start play with magic points equal to their POW characteristic score. A character's POW score also acts as a maximum limit to the number of magic points a character can store at any one time.

Magicians can have access to additional pools of magic points, via bound magic spirits (see Call Spirit) and magic items that act as magic point stores (see Create Magic Point Store). However, these pools regenerate, if at all, independently of the character's natural rate (see below). Experienced Personal Magic users will have several magic point stores and bound magic spirits at their disposal, which allows them to cast many of their spells without using their precious pool of magic points.

A magician whose magic points fall to zero falls unconscious until they have regained one magic point.

### Regaining Magic Points

Using magic points is a draining and exhausting activity that requires a significant effort from which the body needs to recover. Magic points regenerate once the character entirely rests, either by sitting down and taking it extremely easy or by having a good night's sleep.

For every two hours that a character rests, they regain magic points equal to a quarter of their total POW.

If the character has a comfortable uninterrupted sleep of eight hours, they will regain their full magic points.

Characters may never exceed their original magic point total by resting.

## Learning Personal Magic Casting

Personal Magic Casting is a skill. The base percentage is POW X 3. The Personal Magic Casting skill determines the success for casting all Personal Magic spells. Under the default rules, during character generation all player characters gain Personal Magic Casting skill at the base level and 6 points of magnitude of spells.

## Learning Personal Magic Spells

Characters can learn Personal Magic spells from other characters who know the spell. If the spell has a variable magnitude, the teacher must know it at the magnitude that the character wants to learn it or higher. It costs one growth point per magnitude point to learn a Personal Magic spell. If a character knows a spell at a lower magnitude, they only have to pay the difference in growth points to gain the spell at a higher magnitude.

Of all the approaches, Personal Magic is the least powerful, but it is the easiest to obtain.

 Several sources teach Personal Magic.

- _From local folklore and tradition._ Families hand down spells, and the local Wise can teach healing spells and so on to good members of the community.
- _From remote hermits and otherworldly Shamans,_ who commune with the Spirit World and learn its secrets.
- _From local priests._ Who teach Personal Magic associated with their gods' mythological exploits.

In each case, the player character must be in good standing with the teacher before they teach them the spell. If the teacher is indifferent to the player character to start with, then they will first need to undertake some kind of service, which can be the focus of an adventure.

## Casting Spells

A character must be able to move their hands to make gestures and be able to chant to cast a spell and must be able to see their target.

When the character is casting a spell under duress, such as during combat, they must pass a Personal Magic Casting test to cast the spell successfully. In this regard, Personal Magic is like any other skill. If the character is relaxed and has all the time in the world, then no casting test is needed, the spell is automatically cast.

If the Personal Magic Casting test succeeds, the caster spends magic points equal to the magnitude of the spell. The spell then takes effect.

If the Personal Magic Casting test fails, the spell does not take effect, and the character loses one magic point.

### Critical Success

A critical success on a Personal Magic Casting test means that the caster has been able to control the flow of the magic particularly effectively. The character loses one magic point instead of the normal cost of the spell.

### Fumble

A fumble on a Personal Magic Casting test means that the caster has been unable to control the flow of the Personal Magic. Rather than losing a single magic point for failing to cast the spell, the caster loses the full cost of the spell, as if they had cast it successfully.

## Casting Time

Casting a spell is an action that requires full concentration, though the character may slowly walk up to half their movement during spell casting.

All spells take one combat round to cast.

Casting begins at the start of the combat round, and a spell's effect happens on the caster's Personal Magic Casting Skill.

Distractions, or attacks on the caster as they cast, will automatically ruin the spell, unless the caster successfully passes a Persistence test, thereby maintaining concentration on the spell. Examples of distraction include blinding, disarming, or wounding the caster.

## Limits to Personal Magic

### Maximum Known Spells

A character has a limit of their POW in magnitude in spells. So, for example, a character with a POW of 10 could learn Babel (which has a fixed magnitude of 2), Coordination 3 Disruption 3 and Heal 2, which is a total of ten points of magnitude.

Wises have double this limit, i.e. POW x 2, due to their affinity with this type of magic.

### Limits to Variable Magic

Some Personal Magic spells are variable, which means that they can have a magnitude of anywhere from one to a maximum value of six.

The specialist caster, the Wise, because of their greater understanding of Personal Magic ignore this limit.

## Dismissing Spells

In a single combat round, a caster can dismiss any permanent spell(s) they have cast, as a free action. Ceasing to cast a spell being concentrated on is immediate and not an action.

## Spell Traits

Unless otherwise stated, all Personal Magic spells have the following traits.

- They have a variable magnitude, which means that the magnitude of the spell starts from the stated magnitude and then can be cast at a higher magnitude, if the caster knows it, giving an increase in the effect of the spell.
- Base magnitude is one.
- The range is equal to the caster's POWx3 in metres.
- All spells, unless noted, have a duration of ten minutes.

Other traits used by spells are detailed below.

_Area (X):_ The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.

_Concentration:_ The spell's effects will remain in place so long as the character continues to concentrate on it. Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the caster to continue to chant and ignore distractions.

_Instant:_ The spell's effects take place instantly. The spell itself then disappears.

_Magnitude (X):_ The strength and power of the spell. Also, the minimum number of magic points required to cast it.

_Non-Variable:_ The spell has a fixed magnitude.

_Permanent:_ The spell's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed.

_Resist (Dodge/Persistence/Resilience):_ The spell's intended effects do not succeed automatically. The target may make a Dodge, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Dodge) spells require the target to be able to use the Dodge reaction and are subject to the usual cumulative -20% modifier for taking previous reactions already in that combat round. In the case of spells with an area effect, the Resist (Dodge) trait needs the target to dive to avoid the spell's effect.

_Touch:_ These spells require the character to touch their target for the spell to take effect, using an Unarmed skill test to make contact. The caster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.

## Spell Descriptions

### Animal Whisperer

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Touch

The caster whispers into the ear of a distressed animal, calming it. If the distressed animal is under the influence of a spell such as Fear (see Divine Magic) or Scare (see below), then it gets another Persistence test to shake off the effect of the spell.

### Babel

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

If the target fails their Persistence roll, this spell garbles the language of the affected creature. The target can still think and, for the most part, act normally, but anything it says comes out as gibberish. Thus, a commanding officer would be unable to give orders to their men, and a spell caster would be unable to cast spells.

### Back Eyes

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

This spell grants the recipient awareness as if they had physically got eyes in the back of their head for the duration of the spell, which allows them to make Perception rolls and be aware of others behind them.

### Beast Call

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Instant, Resist (Resilience)

The Beast Call serves to attract an animal within range. When the spell is cast, it affects a targeted creature with a fixed INT of 7 or less. If it fails to resist, the creature will go to the place where the caster stands, and the spell effect terminates. Any barrier, immediate threat, or counter control, also end the effects of the spell, leaving the creature to react naturally.

_For example_, the Beast Call spell might cause a horse to turn and walk towards the spell, but a single yank of its reins by the rider would end the spell's effect.

This spell is a potent aid to hunters and herders.

### Befuddle

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

This spell confuses and clouds the mind of its target if they fail a Persistence roll. The affected target may not cast spells and may only take non-offensive actions. The target may run if it so chooses and may dodge and normally parry in combat. Any skills that have INT as a base are at -20% when tested while the target is under the effects of this spell.

This spell is effective against humanoids and natural creatures. Other creatures (such as spirits or magical beasts like dragons) are not affected by this spell.

### Block Sense (Sense)

Magnitude 3, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

Depending on the version of this spell it will Blind/Deafen/Desensitise taste or smell/Numb touch on a failed resistance roll for the duration of the spell.

### Call Spirit (Type)

Magnitude 3, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

This spell summons a single spirit of a given type from the Spirit World to do the bidding of the caster. The spirit resists the call by using its Persistence. If it succeeds, it can return to the Spirit World. Unless combined with a Binding attempt (see below), the spirit that fails a Persistence roll must perform one action, within its power, for the caster, after which it returns to the Spirit World.

_Types of Spirits_

- Disease spirits inflict disease upon the possessed victim.
- Passion (Fear/Madness/Pain) these spirits work upon the passions of a victim and cause mental debilitation and distress.
- Healing spirits heal wounds and drive out possessing disease spirits.
- Magic spirits know spells and have magic points that the caller may use.
- For more information about Spirits, see the Creatures chapter.

#### Binding Spirits

If the character wants to bind a spirit, they must engage in spiritual combat. If they win, they can bind the spirit to an item or their person, by spending an additional growth point. If they fail, the spirit either flees to the Spirit World if it is a Magic or Healing spirit or possesses the caster if it is a Disease or Passion spirit.

### Care

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Touch

This spell places the recipient under the care of the caster. If the caster has any active Protection or Countermagic spells, the character under the effects of the Care spell also benefits from the effects of these spells.

### Clear Path

Touch

This spell allows the caster to move through even the most tangled, thorny brush as if they were on an open road. For each additional point of magnitude, an additional person can accompany them.

### Coordination

Touch

For every point of magnitude.

+10% added to the target's combat order.

+10% to Dodge or DEX based Athletics tests.

### Countermagic

Instant

This spell is cast in advance and sits dormant until a hostile spell attacks the recipient. At this point, the Countermagic spell fires off. As long as Countermagic's magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell's magnitude, the target spell does not take effect. After the Countermagic tries to block a spell, successfully or not, it ends.

### Cover Blind Side

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable

For the duration of the spell, the target can react to attacks from behind or flank attacks as if they were a normal attack from the front. It does not confer any additional reactions.

### Create Charms

Permanent

A charm is a physical item that stores one or more Personal Magic spells. A charm could be a necklace that holds a Befuddle 4 spell; a sword etched with runes that holds a Weapon Enhance 2 spell; or even a sheet of paper with a poem written on it that, when held against the skin, provides a Protection 1 spell.

To create a charm a character must possess both the spell they wish to store and Create Charm at the same or greater magnitude.

The item which going to hold the charm within close range of the caster for the length of the casting.

If the caster spends one growth point at the time of creation, the spell within the charm is reusable. Otherwise once the spell is cast the charm is dispelled.

A spell stored in a charm uses the wielder's Personal Magic Casting skill and the wielder's magic points.

The time taken to create a single-use charm is one hour per point of the magnitude of the spell; Reusable charms take three hours per point of magnitude to create.

Charms are mundane items. Breaking the item dispels the charm.

### Create Magic Point Store

Permanent

This spell allows the caster to create an item which has magic point storing capabilities. Magic Point Stores allow the owner to have a pool of magic points in addition to their own.

Typically, crystals, due to their physical toughness, make good stores. This spell can also be combined with an existing charm, such as a sword with Weapon Enhance 2 stored in it, to provide a pool of magic points to cast the spell from. In-game terms treat anything enchanted with this spell as unbreakable.

Magic point stores take one hour per magic point stored in them to create.

The caster must fill the item with their magic points as part of the spell. The number of magic points put into the item at the time of casting becomes the maximum.

By default, when used, the stored magic points do not regenerate and when all used up the spell ends. If the caster spends one growth point while creating the store, it is reusable, and the caster can refill the store using their magic points.

If the item containing the store becomes damaged or destroyed, the magic points are released harmlessly into the surrounding area.

### Create Potion

Permanent

Potions are liquids that store one or more Personal Magic spells. The magnitude of the Create Potion spell needs to equal or exceed the total of the magnitude of the spells placed into the potion.

All potions are one use. They must be drunk in one swift gulp to work.

The potion automatically works and doesn't incur a cost in magic points to the person who is drinking it.

If multiple spells are placed in the potion, they are all cast on the drinker when the potion is drunk.

Drinking the potion takes place on the drinker's Athletics skill, if the timing is important such as when determining combat order.

The potion costs the enchanter magic points. They must know the spell at the magnitude enchanting at, with the magic points of the spell(s) placed into the potion.

There is an associated cost of 1 Gold Ducat per magnitude in materials, which includes the flask that contains the potion.

Potions take one hour per point of the magnitude of the spell(s) stored to create.

An airtight container must be used to store a potion, or it evaporates, losing one point of magnitude per week.

### Create Scroll

Permanent

This spell allows the caster to create a written version of the spell for use later. Either to impart knowledge of the spell to a trainee or as a reference when casting the spell in the field.

The caster must be able to read and write in some form of written language, which is represented by having a Language skill of over 80%. They must also pay for the special inks and scroll paper (1 Gold Ducat per point of magnitude).

The trainee must be able to read the language that the scroll uses. Once every three months they may study the scroll, which takes one day per point of spell, and then make a Language skill test. If successful, they spend the normal growth cost to learn the spell. If they roll a critical they half that cost, to the nearest whole unit. If they fumble, they can never learn the spell from that scroll, it is beyond their understanding.

To directly cast a spell from the scroll, the caster must be able to read the language the scroll uses. Then cast the spell as normal. Casting is much slower than if the caster is casting the spell from memory. First, the caster reads the spell out loud and then harnesses and shapes the magical energies. Therefore, no matter what their normal casting skill, the spell takes an entire combat round to cast, and fires off at the end of the combat round.

In both cases, once learnt or cast, unless the original writer spends one growth point at the time of creation to make the scroll reusable, the ink fades, and the scroll crumbles to dust.

### Cushion Fall

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

The successful casting of this spell eliminates all falling damage for the recipient for the duration of the spell.

### Darkwall

Area 5m, Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

Light sources within a Darkwall area shed no light, and normal sight ceases to function. Other senses such as a bat's sonar and night vision (see chapter 11 Creatures) function normally.

The caster may move the Darkwall 15 metres per combat round if they concentrate on the spell.

### Demoralise

Magnitude 2, Resist (Persistence), Non-Variable

This spell creates doubt and uncertainty into the very heart and soul of the target. The target of this spell has all combat skills halved and may not cast offensive spells. If this spell takes effect before combat begins, the target will try to avoid fighting and will either run or surrender. The Fanaticism spell automatically cancels the effects of this spell, and vice versa.

### Detect (Type)

Magnitude 1, Concentration, Non-Variable

This description covers a family of spells that all operate similarly, allowing the caster to locate the closest target of the spell within its range. Any Detect spell is stopped by a thick substance, such as metal, earth or stone, at least one metre thick. It is also blocked by Countermagic, though the caster will know the target is somewhere within range (though not its precise location) and that Countermagic is protecting it. The separate Detect spells are listed below, and each must be learned separately.

_Detect Enemy:_ Gives the location of the nearest creatures that intend to harm the caster.

_Detect Magic:_ Gives the location of the nearest magic item, magical creature or active spell.

_Detect Species:_ Each Detect Species spell will give the location of the nearest creature of the specified species. Examples of this spell include Detect Goblin, Detect Rhino and Detect Elf.

_Detect Substance:_ Each Detect Substance spell will give the location of the nearest substance of the specified type. Examples of this spell include Detect Coal, Detect Gold and Detect Wood.

### Dispel Magic

Instant

This spell will attack and eliminate other spells. Dispel Magic will eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its magnitude, starting with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell's magnitude is too high), then its effects immediately end. Dispel Magic cannot partially dispel spells, so a target under the effects of a spell whose magnitude is higher than that of Dispel Magic will not have any spells currently affecting it eliminated.

### Disruption

Instant, Resist (Resilience)

Disruption pulls a target's body apart. On a failed Resilience skill test, the target will suffer 1D4 points of damage per point of magnitude, ignoring any armour points.

### Drive Out Spirit

Instant, Resist (Persistence), Variable

This spell excommunicates a spirit that is either covertly or dominantly, possessing a character or physical location. The spirit resists eviction from its host using its Persistence, with a penalty of -10% for every magnitude point of the spell. If the spirit fails the test, it goes back to the Spirit World.

### Dull Weapon

This spell works on any weapon. For every point of magnitude, it reduces the damage dealt by the target weapon by two points. This spell does not affect the damage inflicted by the damage bonus of the user.

### Enhance (Skill)

Like Detect (Type), this includes several different spells, each of which affects a different non-combat skill. For each point of magnitude, the recipient gains +10% to any skill test using the Enhanced skill. Alternatively, for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the caster can affect one more target. How the caster allocates this magnitude between bonuses and targets is up to the caster, providing each bonus are in multiples of 10%, and the total of bonuses equals the spells magnitude x 10%.

_For example_, Ethelred may have Enhance (Deception) 5. He could cast it all on himself to give a whopping +50% to their Deception or could cast it on himself and an ally, giving himself +30% and their ally +20%. If in a larger group, he could even cast it on 5 allies, each of whom would gain +10% to their Deception skill.

The most common spells of this type are:

_Enhance (Deception)_, often used by thieves.

_Enhance (Trade)_, used by merchants.

_Enhance (Influence)_, used by lawyers, con-artists and officers.

_Enhance (Resilience)_, used by warriors.

_Enhance (Persistence)_, used by magicians.

### Extinguish

Instant

This spell instantly puts out fires. At magnitude 1 it can extinguish a flame, magnitude 2 a small fire, magnitude 3 a large fire and magnitude 4 will put out an inferno.

### Fanaticism

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

The target of this spell will have close combat and unarmed combat skills increased by +20% but may not attempt to cast spells. Also, for the duration of the spell, the target has a +50% bonus to any Persistence test. The Demoralise spell and vice versa automatically cancel the effects of this spell.

### Farsight

Concentration

Each point of this spell extends the caster's field of vision by twenty metres as long as they maintain their concentration. Although they can see small details at a distance, this spell does not let the caster see through walls or other obstructions.

### Firearrow

Magnitude 2, Touch, Non-Variable

Casting this spell on a missile weapon will allow it to fire magical missiles of flame. When one of these missiles hits a target, it deals 1D10 points of magical fire damage. Since the Firearrow does magical damage, it affects creatures that are immune to normal damage. A target remains on fire once hit, taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they spend a combat action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts Extinguish on them. A missile weapon under the effects of Firearrow cannot benefit from Multimissile or Speedart

### Fireblade

Magnitude 4, Touch, Non-Variable

For the duration of the spell, the target weapon deals an additional 1D10 magical fire damage as well as its normal damage. One struck by the weapon remains on fire, taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they spend a combat action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts Extinguish on them. A weapon under the effects of Fireblade cannot benefit from Weapon Enhance. Since Fireblade does magical damage, it damages creatures immune to normal damage."

### Fist of Gold

This spell creates a minor illusion of 1D10 Gold Ducats per level of magnitude that persists for the duration of the spell.

### Fist of the Wind

Instant

Each point of magnitude allows the caster to make one extra unarmed attack. These attacks happen in a blur of motion as soon as the spell fires (i.e. when the spell takes effect), instead of the normal combat order that the character's attacks happen on. An attack roll is made separately for each attack.

### Frostbite

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Instant, Resist (Resilience)

This attack spell allows the caster to freeze their opponent, dealing 1D8 points of damage, ignoring any armour points. Magical protection that protects against cold damage can block this effect, but mundane items (such as severe weather gear) are ineffective.

### Glue

Touch, Area

This spell covers an area of one centimetre square for each magnitude with extremely sticky glue. If a creature steps on the glue, it must make an Athletics roll vs. the magnitude x 10% to avoid being stuck for one round. On subsequent rounds, it must make the same roll to break free. This spell can also make conventional repairs, for example repairing a broken sword, with magnitude x 10% being the chance that the item won't break again if used in circumstances that would cause it to.

### Harden

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Touch

This spell makes a target item unbreakable for the duration of the spell. Therefore, weapons with this spell cast on them will not break when a fumble occurs in combat, and it allows items that are normally too brittle to be wielded in combat to be used as improvised weapons.

### Heal

Instant, Touch

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the caster can repair one hit point to damage to either themselves or another target.

_Mortal Wounds_. A magnitude 6 or higher Heal spell will heal a mortal wound (any damage that takes the character to zero hit point or less) instantly, restoring them to one hit point.

_Curing Disease or Poison._ At magnitude 5 or higher , a Heal spell will also cure any single poison or disease affecting the target. Lost hit points are restored normally, but any other damage caused by the poison or disease, such as characteristic loss, will not be restored.

This spell can not be used to bring characters who are dead back to life.

### Hinder (Skill)

Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

Like Enhance (Skill), this is several different spells, each of which affects a different skill. For each point of the magnitude of the spell, the target gains a -10% penalty to the next skill test using the affected skill.

Alternatively, for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the caster can affect one more target. The bonuses and targets are allocated as necessary, provided each penalty is in multiples of 10%, and the total of bonuses equals the spell's magnitude x 10%. If used in this way, each target is affected separately; if one target succeeds in resisting the spell, other targets may fail and be affected.

The most common spells of this type are as follows.

- _Hinder (Perception)_, often used by thieves.
- _Hinder (Trade)_, used by the nastier traders.
- _Hinder (Persistence),_ used by magicians against enemy spellcasters before casting spells upon them.

### Ignite

Instant, Magnitude 1, Non-Variable

Ignite will set fire to anything flammable within range, creating a flame. If the target is attached to a living being (such as hair, fur or clothes), then the spell gains the Resist (Resilience) trait. Damage is dependent on the size of the Target (see page 86) but for a typical human-sized creature is 1D6 per round.

### Ironmind

Magnitude 3, Non-variable.

This spell hardens the resolve of the recipient for its duration. The spell adds 20 % to all Persistence tests against magical attacks to the mind (e.g. Fear, Befuddle, etc.) or opposed tests vs. Influence.

### Leap

Touch, Resist (Dodge)

This spell causes the target to leap 2m up in the air for each point of magnitude. If cast upon an unwilling target, make a resistance roll and roll for falling damage on failure.

### Levitating Disc

Concentration, Area 1 per Magnitude

This spell creates an invisible disc, 1m in diameter for each point of magnitude. It can carry weight equivalent to one person and their belongings per point of magnitude and moves at twice the magnitude in metres per combat round.

_For example_, a Levitating Disc with magnitude 3 can carry 3 people, is 3m in diameter, and moves at a rate of 6m per combat round.

### Light

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Area 10

When cast on a physical object (including living material), this spell causes the object to shed light across the area of effect. The spell illuminates only the specified area – everything outside the area of effect is not lit. This spell creates raw light, not a flame.

### Lock

Touch, Permanent

This spell gives an item a resistance to being opened equal to the spell's magnitude x 10%. The item must have a lock, such as might be found on a door or a chest, as a focus for the spell. Once the lock has been forced/picked, the spell ends.

### Mindspeech

This spell can affect one target for every point of magnitude. It allows telepathy between the caster and any target, though targets will not have telepathy with one another. The words transmitted by telepathy must be whispered and will be heard directly in the head of the recipient, in the same language in which the caster spoke it.

### Mobility

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the target's movement rate increases by an additional two meters.

### Multimissile

Touch

If the caster succeeds in casting the spell, a missile weapon holds the spell for ten minutes. A missile under the effects of Multimissile cannot benefit from Firearrow or Speedart.

When the Multimissile-enchanted missile is fired or thrown, one additional magical missile fires for every point of magnitude. Each magic missile's attack is separate, and each does the same damage as the original (though they will not benefit from the character's damage modifier). Magical missiles created through Multimissile will not cause critical hits, though the original missile can. Magical missiles created through Multimissile will affect creatures that can only be hurt by magic.

### Personal Insight

Magnitude 2 Non-Variable

This spell gives the caster or recipient a straightforward insight into a small question directly relevant to them, in the form of an internal intuition.

_For example_ the question "Why can I not harm the creature?" would get the answer "Because your sword is not enchanted", while "Why can we not harm the creature?" would not get an answer.

### Pierce

Touch

This spell affects any weapon with a blade or point. For every point of magnitude, it ignores one armour point when it strikes armour. Pierce can bypass magical armour as easily as normal armour.

### Protection

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the armour of the target gains one additional armour point.

### Push/Pull

Instant, Resist (Resilience)

This spell allows the caster to move an item of up to 3 SIZ or ENC per point of magnitude either towards or away from them in a straight line as if pushed suddenly from one direction or the other. The item does not move with significant enough force to inflict damage unless it is naturally damaging (a bottle of acid, for instance). The caster has no control over the distance pushed or pulled, as this depends on the location of the item and/or the surface on which it rests. Living creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a Resilience roll to resist.

### Read Emotion

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Instant, Resist (Persistence)

This spell, when cast, tells you what the true emotional state of the target is if they fail a Persistence roll.

### Resist (Element)

This spell increases resistance against hostile effects, magic or otherwise, from a given element (Air/Darkness/Earth/Fire/Water) by 10% per point of magnitude and subtracts 2 points of damage from that element per point of magnitude.

### Restore Energy

Instant, Touch

Each point of this spell's magnitude instantly removes one fatigue level from the recipient.

### Sap Energy

Instant, Touch, Resist (Resilience)

Each point of this spell's magnitude adds one fatigue level from the target upon a failed Resilience roll.

### Scare

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

On a failed resistance roll, the target is scared for 1D6 rounds. Scared targets must withdraw from combat with the caster for the duration of the spell, and move as quickly as they are able, directly away from the caster.

### Second Sight

Magnitude 3, Non-Variable

Second Sight allows the caster to gauge the POW of every creature and magic item within the range. Anything that prevents normal vision stops the spell. The caster will know if each aura created by the illuminated POW is less than their POW, within three points of their POW, or greater than their POW.

Additionally, Second Sight provides a +20% bonus on Perception tests to notice hidden magical items or hiding people or creatures. Second Sight will also reveal invisible entities, though only a hazy image will show (treat such targets as partially obscured).

### Slip

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Resist (Dodge)

The caster makes the ground under the target's feet as slippery as black sheet ice. The target must make a Dodge roll or fall over prone.

### Slow

Resist (Resilience)

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, decrease target's movement rate by 2m. A target's movement may not go below one metre through use of this spell.

### Speedart

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Touch.

This spell is cast on a missile weapon and triggers when fired. It gives a +20% to Ranged Combat and +3 damage while using the weapon. A missile weapon under the effects of Speedart cannot benefit from Firearrow or Multimissile.

### Spirit Shield

This spell forms a magical barrier that protects the caster from magic point loss as the result of a successful attack during spirit combat. Each point of magnitude reduces the damage done by an attacking spirit by one point.

### Strength

Touch

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the target's damage increases by +1 and strength-based athletics tests are +10% per magnitude. Note, the increased damage is not magical damage.

### Talk to Animal

Magnitude 3 Non-Variable

With this spell, the recipient can talk to any beast within ten metres of them. This communication is verbal; therefore, the recipient must be able to speak and be heard by the target animal.

### Tongues

Magnitude 2 Non-Variable

This spell allows the recipient to speak another language perfectly for its duration.

### Truth Seeker

Instant

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of magnitude to their next skill test they make to discover lies, secrets or hidden objects. It does not stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.

### Unlock

Touch, Instant

This spell has a chance of opening a lock equal to the spell's magnitude x 20%, minus any modifiers due to the intricacy of the lock. If cast on a lock that has had a Lock spell cast on it, the test is an opposed test vs. the magnitude x 20% of the Lock spell.

### Vigour

Touch

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the target's hit points increase by +2. A target cannot have its hit points increased in this way to more than twice its original score. Damage is taken from the 'magical' hit points first, so when the spell dissipates the inflicted damage taken on the magical hit points disappears too

### Vomit

Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

This spell disables its victim for 1 round per point of magnitude, due to uncontrollable vomiting. On a fumbled Resilience roll, the victim also takes 1D6 hit points damage.

### Walk on (Element)

Magnitude 3

This spell allows the recipient to walk on the specified element (Air/Darkness/Earth/Fire/Water) without sinking or taking any harm for the spell's duration. With this spell for the appropriate element, the caster can walk across lava, quicksand, water, or even through the air. Each additional point of magnitude increases the duration of the spell by 1 minute.

### Water Breath

Touch

This spell allows the target to breathe water for the duration of the spell. For every point of magnitude, one additional person can breathe water, or the duration is increased by one minute. Water Breath does not affect the target's ability to breathe air.

### Weapon Enhance

Touch

Cast this spell on any close combat weapon or any unarmed attack. For every point of magnitude, it increases the chance to hit with the weapon by +10% and deals one point of extra damage. This extra damage is magical and will affect creatures that can only be hurt by magic. The weapon's base damage remains non-magical. A weapon under the effects of this spell cannot benefit from Fireblade.

## Shamanism

### Becoming a Shaman

In game terms, a character must have a POW of at least 14 and a Personal Magic Casting skill of at least 50%. They then spend five Growth points and gain the skills of Shamanism at the base skill ranking. Becoming a Shaman is a big commitment and is usually not taken by characters during character generation unless the Referee allows it.

#### Shamanism (INT+POW)

This skill provides several spiritual abilities. These abilities, although magical in origin, are always on or, in the case of Disassociate from Body, can be instantly called on. No magic point spend is needed.

_Disassociate from Body._ The Shaman can put their body into a deep sleep, while their spirit travels the Spirit World. A slender silver cord connects the two. If the physical body suffers death, their spirit becomes trapped in the Spirit World. While in the Spirit World, if the Shaman reaches 1 or 0 magic points, their Spirit returns to their body immediately. In this 'dissociated' form, the Shaman can engage in Spirit Combat with an attack equal to their Shamanism score. During their time in the Spirit World, the Shaman has no physical body, therefore is considered STR, CON, DEX and SIZless. They cannot use any skills that are based upon those Characteristics or require a physical presence. The only way that a dissociated shaman can interact with the physical world is through casting spells or spiritually attacking. While disassociated, the Shaman is invisible to the physical world.

_See into the Spirit World._ The Shaman can always see what is happening in the Spirit World and therefore detect spirits that are invisible to non-Shamans.

_Assess the Harmony of the Spirit World._ This ability allows the Shaman to sense if something is wrong with the immediate Spirit World to a range of POW in kilometers.

_Spirit World Knowledge._ The Shaman learns about the geography of the Spirit World and the cultures of its inhabitants.

Able to Initiate Spirit Combat_._ Unlike untrained characters, Shamans can engage spirits in Spirit Combat, without having to cast any extra magic spells. See the Spirit Combat section, under Magical Combat, in the Combat chapter for more details.

#### Commonly Known Personal Magic

Shamans commonly learn the following Personal Magic spells.

Call Spirit (Type), Drive Out Spirit, and Spirit Shield.

#### Limits on Shamans

Due to their differences in views on how magic fundamentally works, Shamans may not use Sorcery. Some Divine Magic Religions may have a place for Shamanism within their practices and belief systems, for example as a form of ancestor worship, and Shamans may join such religions and learn their Divine Magic as a result.

#### Crossing over the Veil and becoming a Great Spirit

Shamans who achieve mastery of Shamanism, know how to become Great Spirits, passing over to the Spirit World. They enter a permanent state of disassociation from their body, which they only inhabit if they need to interact with mortal beings. Their body goes into suspended animation. If the original body is destroyed then they simply possess another, using dominant possession.

Requirements

Shamanism at 100%.

POW at maximum (21 for humans).

Knows ten different Personal Magic spells.

Benefits

POW has no limit.

Disassociates from Body, which goes into permanent suspended animation. Can inhabit it or another body, via dominant possession.

Shamans who become Great Spirits tend to retire after a couple of Quests, as they become more concerned with affairs of the Spirit World than the mundane Real World.

## The Wise

### Becoming a Wise

In game terms, the character POW must be 14 or greater, and they must have Personal Magic Casting skill of over 50%. The character must spend five growth points. Normally, becoming a Wise during character generation is only possible if the Referee allows it since it is a big commitment for the character and something best explored in-game.

### Special Abilities

The Wise have the following special abilities.

#### Access to any Personal Magic spell

Except for those Personal Magic spells exclusive to Religions, they can learn any spell without the need of a teacher. All the Wise needs to do is go into seclusion for one day per point of magnitude they are learning and contemplate the spell that they want to learn. They then spend the usual growth point cost, and the spell is theirs.

#### Ignore Limit on Variable Magnitude

Wises go deeper into the magic than normal characters and can transcend the limit of six points of magnitude on variable spells.

#### Learn more magic spells

The Wise may learn up to POW x 2 in magnitude of spells instead of the normal POW's worth.

#### Create Magical Places

Wises can tune into the streams of magic that flow from the Magical Realm into the Real World and bring these two parallel planes close enough to one another to create magical places that they can use for their benefit.

If this is done in haste and under stress, it requires a successful Personal Magic Casting skill test. All magic places have a volume of 20 metres cubed. The descriptions below give the magic point cost to create specific types of magic place.

_Seclusion._ A hidden place in the wilderness where the Wise can learn magic undisturbed or simply just disappear. The seclusion has a connection to the Real World but technically exists in the Magical Realm. Detected by a character using Second Sight. It costs one magic point per day that it exists. For the duration of the seclusion, the Wise cannot regain the magic points that they have put into its creation. Seclusions can only be used by the Wise or another Wise that they invite into it, due to the special magical understanding that is required to believe that it exists.

_Sanctuary._ A place that gives the wise, and those accompanying them, protection against enemy magic and magical forces. It costs one magic point per hour, but companions accompanying the Wise may contribute magic points. While in the sanctuary any defensive Personal Magic spells, like Counter Magic and Protection, cast by the Wise, apply to anyone. Unlike a seclusion this has to be a real place, such as a cave or a room in a house, that the Wise then connects with the Magical World. Any magic points spent creating the sanctuary do not return until the Wise who created it ends it.

_Power._ The Wise can create a magic store tied to a physical location. The location is between one and the creator's POW metres in radius. At the time of creation, the Wise puts in an amount of Magic Points and can add to them over time. Places of Power, in theory, can store an unlimited amount of magic points. Magic detection spells, such as Second Sight and Mystic Vision, can easily find Places of Power. Other Wises can pull magic points out of the store on an opposed Personal Magic Casting skill test, where the opposing skill is the Personal Magic Casting of the Wise who set up the store originally.

All magic places can be dispelled at will or upon the death of the Wise that created them.

#### The Ability to Understand Magic

Using their Personal Magic Casting skill, the character can discern the effects of any type of magic they come across. A standard success tells them the general effects, and a critical tells them the exact nature of the magic and its source (i.e. Personal/Divine/Sorcery).

#### Commonly Known Personal Magic Spells

Wises commonly learn the following Personal Magic spells.

Countermagic, Create Charm, Create Magic Point Store, Create Scroll, Dispel Magic, Personal Insight, Second Sight.

### Limits on Wises

Wises may never learn Divine Magic or Sorcery, since these formal approaches of magic are contrary to the Wises floating and haphazard view how magic works and sever the link that the Wise has with the magical realm.

### Becoming One with Reality

Wises who reach mastery in spell casting, and have a wide variety of spells and a sanctuary magic place set up, can become one with the land that their sanctuary is in and achieve a kind of immortality.

Requirements

- POW at maximum (21 for humans).
- Personal Magic Casting at 100%.
- Must know least ten different Personal Magic Spells.
- The have created a sanctuary magic place.

Benefits

- Power has no maximum.
- If killed, returns to the sanctuary, and a new body is built from organic matter from the surrounding area over a period of 1D6 days.

Wises who become One with Reality are usually retired from play after a couple of Quests at that level. After tying up a few loose ends in their mortal lives, and defeating one last big threat to their land, they disappear into the wilderness to explore the new intimate relationship they have with their land.
# OQ3 SRD Divine Magic

The first step in learning Divine Magic is to join a religion that worships the deity whose magic the character wants to learn.

## Religions

Religions can range in size from a handful of worshippers to millions of adherents. They teach their members Personal Magic associated with the god and provide temples where worshippers can learn Divine Magic directly from their deity. They have rules for and expectations of their worshippers, and anyone found wanting is expelled from the comfort and support of the religion.

Religions take one of two forms, Pantheon or Dedicated.

_Pantheon religions_ are the worship of many gods, and such groups of gods usually have a ruling deity. Worshippers of this kind of religion usually get a little bit of magic from each of the deities.

_Dedicated religions_ are the worship of one particular deity. The deity may be associated with one or more pantheons and may provide some magic to worshippers of these pantheons, but dedicated religions focus on the individual deity and all its myths and mysteries. As a result, worshippers get the full range of magic that the deity knows.

Characters may be members, at any rank, of both a Pantheon religion and a Dedicated religion of one of the associated deities.

Each religion description uses the following format.

_Name of the Deity or Religion:_ The name that thereligion is commonly known by, usually the name of the deity that it worships.

_Short description:_ This short description briefly covers the religion's mythology and its current place in the world.

_Type of religion:_ Pantheon or Dedicated.

_Scale of worship:_ This is the type and size of the religion. Great Deities are worshipped by millions and known across the entire world. Major Deities are important in a specific region and have hundreds of thousands of worshippers. Minor Deities are usually the minor members of a religious pantheon, appealing to a small group of specialist worshippers. Hero Religions worship dead heroes and heroines whose deeds and magic powers live on after their death.

_Worshippers:_ The type of people who typically make up the religion's membership.

_Worshipper duties:_ This is what the god and religion expect of its members. Break these rules and expect expulsion. On the other hand, follow these rules and promote them to others and the character will advance in the religion's hierarchy.

_Religious skills:_ These are skills favoured by the religion's patron deity and taught to its worshippers by its Priestesses/Priests.

_Religious magic:_ A religion's spells _are u_sually made up of Personal Magic and the Divine Magic that the religion teaches. Both types are available if appropriate to the god's sphere of influence.

For example, A war god is likely to teach Weapon Enhance (Personal Magic) and Berserk rather than Healing spells.

_Special benefits:_ Any bonuses to skill use or other special abilities or advantages that a worshipper gains by being a member of the religion.

## Growth and Worshipper Duties

Each religion has a set of worshipper duties which represent the religion's objectives in the world.

When a character does an action that fulfils one of the worshipper duties, they gain one growth for a minor action and up to three points for a major act.

When a character takes an action that goes against one of the worshipper duties, they lose between one and three growth points, depending on the grievousness of their transgression. If they have no growth points left, then they start to lose points of magnitude learnt from the religion as a penance, on a one to one basis. The player may choose which spells to lose, but they must be ones that they have learnt from the religion, and Divine Magic is lost before Personal Magic spells.

If the offending character has no growth points or spells to lose, then they are excommunicated from the religion and may never join it again.

## Religious Ranks

There are four ranks of religion membership: Lay Members, Initiates, Priests and Holy Warriors.

### **Lay Members**

Lay members are normal worshippers of the religion, who self-identify as members of that religion. They regularly attend the temple on holy days and do their best to uphold the duties of the religion. In return, the religion protects them as best it can, and its Priest and Initiates cast magic on their behalf.

### Benefits of Being a Lay Member

_Personal Magic:_ Lay members cannot learn Divine Magic, although, for a fee, represented by spending growth points, they may learn low magnitude (no more than magnitude 2) Personal Magic spells if known to the religion.

_Protection:_ Officials of the religion do their best to protect lay members. Religious spell casters will cast magic on their behalf at no cost.

_Requirements:_ To be considered a Lay Member of a Religion, the character must broadly uphold the worshipper duties of the religion and have the appropriate Religion skill at least 20%.

### **Initiates**

Initiates are worshippers who have dedicated their lives to the creed of the religion and have taken part in a formal initiation ceremony to initiate them into the inner mysteries of the religion. They are expected to actively live the lifestyle that their religion promotes, and learn the religion's mysteries. They are an example to the lay members and in smaller settlements, such as rural villages, they often take the role of the Priest in leading services on holy days at the local shrine.

_Requirements:_ The relevant Religion skill must be a minimum of 40%, and an Initiate must have one of the religion's skills at a minimum of 25%. Also, the character must spend two growth points on becoming initiated. An initiate must uphold the religion's worshipper duties.

### Benefits of Being an Initiate

_Learn Personal Magic_: Initiates can learn any Personal Magic spell the religion teaches at unlimited magnitude.

_Learn Divine Magic:_ Initiates may learn any Divine Magic spell available to the religion up to magnitude 2.

_Protection:_ As lay members; plus they get free lodging or use of any buildings that the religion owns. Great religions will often have lodging houses, especially for travelling initiates.

### **Priests**

These people are the living embodiment of their faith, instructed by their deity to be its living representatives in the mortal world.  They lead the services for their temple on holy days and are leaders in their community.

_Requirements:_ To become a Priest, a character must have the Religion skill and two of the religion's associated skills at a minimum of 75%; there must also be a vacancy in the temple hierarchy, or the new Priest be willing to become a missionary and establish a new temple. Besides all this, the player must pay five growth points.

### Benefits of being a Priest

_Ransom:_ The religion will pay the ransom if a priest is captured, or make all reasonable attempts to rescue them.

_Learning Personal Magic & Divine Magic:_ A priest may learn all the inner secrets of their religion (this means all available magic at unlimited magnitude). They may also get Divine Magic spells available only to their rank if such spells are listed for the religion.

_Allied Spirit:_ Upon becoming a Priest, the character gains an Allied Spirit. An Allied Spirit is a spirit associated with the deity who is willing to work with one of their mortal worshippers to further the aims of the religion. The Allied Spirit is usually bound in either an animal or an item, sacred to the religion.

If the vessel the spirit lives in, item or animal, is destroyed, then the Allied Spirit returns to its home plane of existence and then returns when a new animal or item is prepared for it.

In the case where Allied Spirit has its magic points reduced to zero, i.e. destroyed, in service, a new Allied Spirit is assigned to the Priest/Priestess.

An Allied Spirit starts with an INT of 2D6+6 and a POW of 3D6 and knows 6 points of Personal Magic and 3 points of Divine Magic known to the religion. The spirit can see immaterial and invisible spirits, alerting its master to their presence in a twenty-metre range. An Allied Spirit is in permanent Mind Link with its master, with a range equal to its POW x5 in meters.

An Allied Spirit has whatever physical characteristics that its host animal or item has.

Allied Spirits are advanced like player characters, by spending growth points from their Priest's total.

### **Holy Warriors**

Holy Warriors who protect the temples and worshippers of their religion. Not all religions have Holy Warriors, especially those religions dedicated to peace, but where they do, these warriors ceaselessly crusade to protect the faithful and punish the religion's enemies.

The minimum requirement to become a Holy Warrior is to have Religion of at least 50% and a combat skill of at least 75%. Besides this, the player must pay five growth points.

_Requirements:_ Uphold the worshipper duties unfailingly. As the religion's warriors, take up arms against any aggressor who attacks its worshippers or the religion's temples.

### Benefits of being a Holy Warrior

_Holy Arms and Armour:_ When someone becomes a Holy Warrior they are gifted a specially consecrated weapon, that gives them a bonus when fighting to defend fellow worshippers, religious temples, and when attacking enemies of their faith. This bonus is usually +20% to the appropriate weapon skill and double damage when fighting for their religion. All damage done by such weapons is considered magical.

They also gain armour, which is magically blessed by the religion's deity. Usually, this is at least double the normal AP of the armour type used, and it may have additional powers depending on the deity.

_Learn Personal Magic & Divine Magic:_ Holy Warriors may learn all the spells available to the religion as Initiates.

_Learn Special Divine Magic: Holy Warriors_ may get additional Divine Magic spells that further enhance their ability to fight on behalf of the religion, at unlimited magnitude. These specific spells are listed for the Holy Warrior. Otherwise, they get the listed divine Magic at a maximum of 2 magnitude.

_Ransom:_ Holy Warriors are incredibly useful to the religion they belong to, which will always pay any ransom or make a rescue attempt if a Holy Warrior is ever captured.

### **Warrior Priests**

Usually, a character cannot be both a Priest and a Holy Warrior. Both are precise roles within the religion which are quite demanding on the character's time. Some religions may have more martially inclined Priestesses/Priests, which combine the functions and abilities of the Priest with that of a Holy Warrior.

## The Universal Earth Mother Religion

The Goddess is the all-embracing and loving Earth Mother worshipped throughout the world. Some people believe that she is the world itself. She is the source of all nature's bounty, which clothes and feeds humanity, but also has a savage side that expresses itself in hurricanes, tidal waves and other natural disasters.

_Type of Religion_: Dedicated Religion (Great Deity).

_Scale of Worship:_ Worldwide.

_Worshippers:_ The religion is made up of people and creatures who live off the land. In civilised areas, these are the peasants who farm the land and the woodsmen who hunt and gather in the forests. Found wherever creatures have an acknowledged connection with nature.

_Worshipper duties_: Respect the Earth. Don't foul or pollute the environment. Don't take more from the world than it can regenerate. Do not needlessly kill or over hunt animals.

_Religious skills:_ Healing, Nature Lore, Resilience.

_Religious magic_

_Personal Magic:_ Heal, Protection.

_Divine Magic:_ All Common spells + Absorption, Berserk, Heal Body.

_Special Benefits_: Any member of this religion gains a +20% bonus to their Nature Lore, due to their connection to Nature, which they gain through their relationship with the Earth Mother.

### The Earth Mother Priestess

These matrons represent the divine Earth Mother at the religion's rituals, and she speaks through them.

Earth Mothers usually bind their Allied Spirits into animals local to their temples, such as cows in urban areas, or foxes and bears in mountain areas. If a suitable animal is not available, branches taken from local trees and fashioned into an Earth Wand are satisfactory.

Due to the nature of the religion, most priestesses are female, but very rarely a male with a strong feminine side will meet the requirements.

### Holy Warriors, The Axe Maidens

These fierce female warriors protect the holy sites of the Earth Mother and extract retribution against the violators of the earth.

_Required Combat skill:_ Close Combat at 75%

_Holy Weapon:_ Axes of any type +20% and double damage vs. Religion enemies.

_Holy Armour:_ Red woad. This mixture of the blood of the religion's enemies and the blessed earth is taken from a holy site, such as the consecrated grounds of an Earth Mother temple, gives a +20% to Dodge rolls and 6 AP.

_Special Divine Magic:_ Axe Maidens can learn the spells of Earth Scream, Shield, True Axe.

### Earth Scream

Area 10m Magnitude 2 Duration 15 Resist Persistence.

When cast the Axe Maiden makes a blood-curdling scream at a group of enemies. If they are within the area of the spell's effect, they make a Persistence test or run away from the Axe Maiden in terror for the duration of the spell.

## Ascension

Through walking the Path of Divine Magic, establishing a relationship with one or more deities or supernatural guardians of the religions that they follow, high ranking Priests and Holy Warriors can undergo a magical process called Ascension, becoming immortal and joining the deities in the Houses of the Holy.

There are two types of Ascended.

- _Ascended Immortal._ A guardian of the religion that they were part of in life. They join the Pantheon- becoming a guardian that can be called upon by worshippers.
- _Ascended Deity._ A deity in their own right who may or may not be worshipped as part of a pantheon or as a dedicated religion.

### Game Requirements

To become an Ascended Immortal.
* Religion (Own) at 100%.
* POW at maximum (21 for humans).
* Ten points of the religion's Divine Magic.
* Pay a growth cost of ten points.

To become an Ascended Deity.
* Religion (Own) at 100%.
* POW at maximum (21 for humans).
* One or more Religion (other) at 100%, to understand wider implications of immortality.
* Ten points of the Religion's Divine magic.
* Pay a growth cost of twenty points.

### Other Story Requirements

As well as these requirements to reach certain numerical scores, there are also more subjective story requirements. Ascended characters are expected to be shining examples of their religion. They have undergone one or more Mythic Journeys (see the spell of the same name) to explore the Divine Other Worlds and understand myths

It might be because of this that characters never reach the lofty levels of the Ascended because they do not meet the story requirements.

### The Powers of the Ascended

Ascended Immortals and Deities both have the following powers.

- The ability to grow Power beyond the normal maximum (21 for humans).
- Immortality; if killed, they return to a safe place in the Houses of the Holy.
- Immune to disease and poison and mind control spells, like Befuddle, Madness or Fear.
- Their worshippers may learn any personal magic or Divine Magic spell that the character knows.
- Also, Ascended Deities may create new Divine Magic spells based upon their actions in play for ten growth per point of spell.

Like Transcended Sorcerers, Ascension is the pinnacle and ultimate goal of a character's career. While it may be fun to play an Ascended character for a couple of Quests, such characters are usually retired after that.

## Asking the Deities for Answers

A very powerful ability of all characters who are members of a religion is the ability to seek answers from the deities that they follow. Guidance from a religion's deities is available in two forms.

Using the _Divination_ spell that is available to all Initiates and Priests as a common Divine Magic spell.

By praying at a temple and _Asking for Divine Guidance_ before going on a Quest.

_Divination_ is the more direct and powerful method and can be called upon multiple times during a Quest, as long as the character has the spell memorised. It can also be called upon by non-player Priests who have a positive relationship with the character.

_Asking for Divine Guidance_ is very limited and can often be even vaguer than Divination.

It can only be done once per Quest, usually in the preparation phase of the Quest.

The character must pray at a temple or shrine of a religion that the character is a member of.

They must make a successful Religion skill test. Otherwise, complete silence ensues.

If the test is successful, the deity may only answer in the form of hints and vague symbolic suggestions.

It's useful if the Referee has a table of random answers – a sort of rumour table of the Gods – pre-written as part of their Quest preparation. Alternatively, a quick bullet point list of what the Deities of a particular temple can tell their worshippers about a Quest from their own bias can be made.

## Learning Divine Magic

To learn Divine Magic spells the caster must meet the following requirements:

The caster must be an Initiate, Holy Warrior or Priest within a religion that teaches the spell the character wants to learn.

The character must pay a cost in growth points, equal to twice the magnitude of the spell, to the deity. Incremental purchase of spells is allowed, e.g. the player buys Shield 1 for two growth points and then later increases this to Shield 3, by spending an additional four points.

## Casting Divine Magic

Divine magic has the following characteristics when casting.

A character must be able to gesture with their hands and be able to chant to cast a spell.

Whenever casting a Divine Magic spell, there will always be a sight and sound that nearby creatures can detect, be it a flash of light, a crack of thunder or shimmering in the air. The exact effects are up to the Referee and player to decide but the caster will automatically be detected by any creatures within ten times the magnitude of the spell, in metres.

Casting Divine Magic is automatically successful and does not cost any magic points when it is cast, since its source is the deity. Divine magic spells always take only a single combat action to cast and take place on the character's Influence skill in combat order.

Having cast a Divine Magic spell the character must perform worshipper duties in downtime to regain the spell; see below for details.

If a spell has variable magnitude and the character knows it at a high magnitude, it can be cast multiple times (see Splitting Magnitude below).

### Regaining Cast Divine Magic

Normally Divine Magic is regained during the downtime between adventures. A character will visit their religion's temples or shrines and regain their magic by participating in quiet contemplation or ecstatic worship as is appropriate to their religion.

In-game characters may regain Divine Magic by one of two ways.

- Each time the character successfully performs a worshipper duty, the character regains the choice of one of their spent spells.
- They may also call on their deity and spend a point of Fortune to regain a spent spell of their choosing.

### Limitations

Divine Magic spells do not stack, e.g. Shield 1 + Shield 2 does not equal Shield 3.

## Dismissing Divine Magic Spells

A caster can dismiss any spell with the Permanent or Duration trait that they have cast as a single combat action. Ceasing to cast a Concentration spell is an immediate free action.

## Splitting Magnitude

Divine magic allows the caster to 'split' a spell's magnitude into multiple spells. For instance, if the caster knows the Absorption spell at magnitude 3, they may choose to cast it as a single magnitude 3 spell, or they may split it into three magnitude 1 Absorption spells, or one magnitude 1 and one magnitude 2 Absorption spell.

## The Power of Divine Magic

When in a direct contest with other forms of magic, Divine Magic has double its normal magnitude.

## Spell Traits

The traits used by Divine Magic spells are detailed below.

Area (X): The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.

_Concentration:_ The spell's effects will remain in place so long as the character concentrates on it. Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the caster to continue to gesture with both arms, chant, and ignore distractions.

_Duration (X)_: The spell's effects will stay in place for the number of minutes indicated.

_Instant:_ The spell's effects take place instantly. The spell itself then disappears.

_Magnitude (X)_: The strength and power of the spell. Also, the minimum number of magic points required to cast it.

_Non-Variable:_ The spell costs the stated magnitude, which may not be increased or decreased.

_Permanent:_ The spell's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed.

_Progressive:_ This indicates that the spell can be learnt and cast at greater levels of magnitude than the minimum.

_Ranged:_ These spells have a maximum distance of the character's POW x 5 in metres.

_Resist (Dodge/Persistence/Resilience):_ The spell's effects do not take effect automatically. The target may make a Dodge, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) in order to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Dodge) spells require the target to be able to use Reactions to Dodge. In the case of Area spells, the Resist (Dodge) trait requires the target to dive to avoid the spell's effect.

_Touch:_ These spells require the character to actually touch their target for the spell to take effect. The caster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.

_Common:_ If the spell Common spell, available to learn from all religions. Here's a quick list for reference:

Consecrate, Create Blessed Item, Create Idol, Dismiss Magic, Divination, Excommunicate, Exorcism, Extension, Mindlink, Soul Sight,
 Spirit Block, Mythic Journey.

_Variable:_ The spell has a non-set magnitude.

## Spell Descriptions

### Absorption

Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

This spell absorbs incoming spells aimed at the target or their equipment, converting their magical energy into magic points which are then available to the target. Once cast on a subject, Absorption will attempt to absorb the effects of any spells cast at the target. It will not have any effect on spells that are already affecting a character. The effects of Absorption depend on the relative magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell – see the Absorption Results table for more details. Any spell absorbed by this spell is cancelled and does not affect the target.

***Absorption Results***

| Incoming Spell's Magnitude is | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Equal to or weaker than Absorption's magnitude. | Incoming spell absorbed and Absorption remains. |
| 1 or more points stronger than Absorption's magnitude. | Absorption eliminated and incoming spell takes effect. |

A character may not accumulate more magic points than his POW while Absorption is in effect – excess magic points garnered through Absorption simply vanish. Absorption is incompatible with Reflection, Shield and Spirit Block.

### Berserk

Duration 15, Magnitude 2, Non-variable, Touch

The recipient of this spell is overcome with blood-lust, causing them to disregard their safety and loyalties but imbuing them with tremendous stamina and combat ability.

The recipient will automatically succeed any Resilience test for the duration of the spell. The recipient also automatically succeeds at any Fatigue tests and cannot be rendered unconscious. The Close Combat skills of the recipient receive a +50% bonus for the spell's duration.

However, the subject may not Parry, Dodge or cast any magic spells while under the influence of Berserk. Normally, the recipient remains in the Berserk state for the entire 15-minute duration of the spell. Still, Referees may allow a Berserk character to shake off the effects with a Persistence test modified by -50%. At the end of the spell, the recipient immediately becomes Fatigued.

Berserk does not combine with Fanaticism – Berserk will always take precedence in such cases.

### Block Fertility

Magnitude 3, Non-variable, Permanent

While this spell is in place, the recipient is unable to conceive. Depending on the view of the recipient, this is a blessing or a curse. The spell can be dispelled by the caster whenever they want. Otherwise, the effects of the spell are permanent.

### Breathe Water

Duration 15, Magnitude 2, Non-variable, Touch

This spell allows an air-breathing creature to breathe water for the spell's duration (the subject will still be able to breathe air as well). It may also be used upon a water-breathing creature to allow it to breathe air.

### Call (Elemental)

Magnitude 1, Permanent, Progressive

This spell summons and binds to the service of the caster an elemental from another plane of existence, of size dependent on the magnitude of the spell.

1 = Small, 2= Medium, 3= Large, 4=Huge

For more details on Elementals, see Chapter 11 'Creatures'.

The elemental stays under the control of the Priest until killed, or the Call spell is dispelled.

To be successfully cast, the spell requires an equal volume of the source material for the elemental. For example, before a successful summoning, a Large Undine (Water elemental) requires a pool of water of at least 50m3.

### Call (Undead)

Magnitude 1, Permanent, Progressive

This spell reanimates a dead human corpse and turns it into an undead creature, of a type determined by the magnitude of the spell.

1 = Skeleton, 2 = Zombie, 5= Ghoul, 8= Vampire

The undead creature stays under the control of the Priest until killed.

### Consecrate

Area Special, Common, Magnitude 1, Permanent, Progressive

This spell is as much a part of a temple's foundation as is its cornerstone. It creates a sphere with a radius of ten metres per point of magnitude. The consecrated sphere is sacred to the caster's god. Consecrate by itself does nothing to keep outsiders at bay, but the caster of the spell will know if a spell, spirit or someone who is not a lay member of his religion, crosses the boundaries of the Consecrate spell.

### Create Blessed Items

Area Special, Common, Magnitude 1, Permanent, Progressive

This spell allows the caster to create items which store Divine Magic spell(s) that are blessed by a Priest with power from the religion's deity.

Only Priests and High Priests can create blessed items.

The enchanter forgets the spell(s) they blessed the item with.

The wielder of the item can cast the spell(s) that has blessed the item but doing so discharges the item's power. After discharging it, to recharge the item, it is taken to a temple of the religion that created it. This recharge takes as many hours as the magnitude of the spell. If the magnitude of the spell is higher than two, the consecrating team must have at least one Priest.

The wielder must be a member of either the religion that created the blessed item or an allied religion.

Blessed items become protected by the religion's deity and are unbreakable by normal non-magical means.

### Create Idol

Common, Magnitude 4, Permanent

This spell requires an image of the caster's god worth 100 GD, specially consecrated by a Priest reading from the sacred texts of the deity telling the tales and myths. The idol stores the god's spells and can be used by Priest and Initiates to regain spells. It can be used by Lay Members to receive 'lessons', via visions, upon touching the idol. Such visions will increase the Religion skill of a Lay Member by 1D10% when exposed to them.

### Create the Crystal Ship

Magnitude 4, duration the length of the voyage

From out of the air coalesces the Crystal Ship, a magical vessel that sails through the air to a single destination preordained by the caster. The caster need never have been there, but the caster's deity must know of it. The ship is about the size of a merchant cog and fitted with no weapons. Although the ship heads steadily towards the destination, at a rate of 100 km a day, the fine manoeuvring of the ship is managed by the thoughts of the caster.

### Dismiss Magic

Common, Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

Dismiss Magic is used either against a general target or a specific spell and as a reaction when attacked with magic.

When used against a general target, Dismiss Magic will eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its magnitude, starting with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell's magnitude is too high), then its effects immediately end and it will dispel no more spells.

The caster can also target Dismiss Magic against a single specific spell. It will work successfully as long as Dismiss Magic's magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell's magnitude.

When used as a defensive reaction against incoming magic, as long as the attacking caster is within Dismiss Magic's range, a successful Dismiss Magic disrupts the other spell and nullifies it.

### Divination

Common, Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive

For each point of the magnitude of this spell, the caster can ask one question of their deity, which they must answer to the best of their ability. A deity can only answer questions it knows about, and that falls within its sphere of power. For example, a Mountain God will know exactly what is going on its slopes at any given time but will be completely ignorant about the ocean.

Gods will also commonly ask for a sacrifice of an animal or precious object worth one gold ducat per question asked. Particularly cruel and bloodthirsty deities will demand blood sacrifices of sentient beings.

Note, a weaker and less direct form of divination can be obtained at temples and shrines, without use of this spell. See Asking the Gods above.

### Divine Heal

Instant, Magnitude 2, Non-variable, Touch

This powerful spell instantly heals any lost hit points, even if the character is mortally wounded, back to their full total. It also cures any natural disease, i.e. one not caused by a spirit; and any deadly poison is purged instantly from the character. Any damage or effects caused by it are removed.

### Enhance Fertility

Magnitude 3, Non-variable, Permanent

This spell makes any one creature more fertile than normal. If it is an animal that has multiple offspring, then it doubles the number. For creatures who usually have singular births, it guarantees the conception and birth of the offspring.

This spell negates the effects of any "Block Fertility" spell.

### Enhance Unit

Magnitude 3, Non-variable, Duration 6 hours

For the duration of this spell, a troop of up to thirty soldiers gain +1D6 damage. Also, they cannot be routed or affected by any mind control magic (such as Befuddle).

### Excommunicate

Common, Magnitude 5, Non-variable, Permanent, Resist (Persistence)

This spell severs the mystical link an Initiate enjoys with their god, causing the target of the spell to immediately and permanently lose all Divine Magic from the caster's religion. The target will never again be able to learn or use Divine Magic spells from the religion. However, they will still be able to use their Religion skill for purely academic purposes.

A Priest of the same religion as the target casts the spell in a ceremony that takes one hour to cast. The Initiate need not be present.

### Exorcism

Common, Concentration, Magnitude 3, Non-variable

A Divine Magic caster can draw out a spirit currently possessing a mortal being by using this spell. Whether the possession is dominant or covert is immaterial.

This spell forces a possessing spirit into Spirit Combat (see Combat). The caster uses his Religion (Own) as the attacking skill in the opposed contest, as this represents the strength of their faith. If the caster is successful in defeating the spirit, it is cast out of the victim and flees. If the caster fails, the spirit remains in the possessed victim.

### Extension

Common, Duration Special, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell lengthens the duration of any Divine Magic spell with the Duration trait. Extension, and the spell it is extending, are cast simultaneously by the caster – this is an exception to the normal rule that only one Divine Magic spell is cast during a combat round.

Each point of magnitude of the Extension spell doubles the target spell's duration. Thus, a magnitude 1 Extension increases Breathe Water's Duration to 30 minutes, a magnitude 2 increases it to one hour, magnitude 3 increases it to two hours, magnitude 4 increases it to four hours, and so on.

### Fear

Instant, Magnitude 1, Ranged, Resist (Persistence), Non-variable

This spell causes the target to become overwhelmed with fear. Fear does not affect unconscious targets, those without an INT characteristic or those that are currently under the influence of a Fear spell.

***Fear Effects***

| Target's Persistence Test | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Target fumbles Persistence test | The victim instantly loses half original hit points damage, as its heart falters. Falls into a coma for 1D12 hours. |
| Target fails Persistence test | The victim flees in screaming terror for combat rounds equal to 20 minus its POW (minimum of one combat round). The victim will not engage in combat unless forced to and will use the Run combat action whenever possible (unless a faster mode of egress is available). |
| Target succeeds Persistence test | The victim is shaken and disturbed, suffering a –20% penalty to all skill tests for combat rounds equal to 20 minus its POW (minimum of one combat round). |
| Target critically succeeds Persistence test | The victim is unaffected by the spell and cannot be affected by further Fear spells for combat rounds equal to its POW. |

### Find (Type)

Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Non-variable, Ranged

This spell is several spells, though they all operate in a similar fashion, which allows the caster to locate the closest target of the spell within its range. This effect is stopped by a thick substance such as metal, earth or stone, if it is at least one metre thick. It is also blocked by Absorption, though the caster will know the target is somewhere within range (though not its precise location). The separate Find spells are listed below.

Unlike the Personal Magic Detect spells, the Find spells do not require concentration on the part of the caster – they simply function and alert them to the presence of whatever they locate.

_Find Enemy:_ Gives the location of one creature who intends to harm the caster.

_Find Magic:_ Gives the location of the nearest magic item, magical creature, or active spell.

_Find (Species):_ Each Find Species spell will give the location of the nearest creature of the specified species. Examples of this spell include Find Goblin, Find Dwarf and Find Horse.

_Find Substance:_ Each Find Substance spell will give the location of the nearest substance of the specified type. Examples of this spell include Find Coal, Find Gold and Find Wood.

The Referee should provide the rough power of the detected subject (e.g. 'weak magic' or 'rich gold lode').

### Illusion

Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell creates an illusion based on all five senses. The illusion will seem real and solid unless the person looking at it succeeds in a Perception test, which is subject to a modifier based on the magnitude of the spell. If the viewer succeeds in a Perception test, and the illusion could usually cause damage if believed in, it can no longer cause damage to that character. As soon as a viewer disbelieves the illusion, it becomes insubstantial and ghost-like to them.

The magnitude also governs the Size of the illusion. A magnitude 1 Illusion can quite happily create small household items, say a fake table and chair, but would not be able to create an illusion of a fire-breathing Dragon.

***Illusions***

| Magnitude | Modifier to Perception test | Type of illusion possible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | +50 % | Not capable of motion or causing damage. Slightly fuzzy and unreal round the edges. Limit of SIZ 10. |
| 2 | +25 % | Some minor discrepancies. Capable of motion, but not of damage. Limit of SIZ 15. |
| 3 | 0 | Capable of motion and causing damage. Limit of SIZ 20. |
| 4 | -25 % | Capable of motion and causing damage. Limit of SIZ 30. |
| 5 | -50 % | Indistinguishable from the real thing, capable of motion and damage. Limit of SIZ 40. |
| +1 | -50% | +10 SIZ per magnitude. |

### Invisibility

Magnitude 4, Non-Variable, Concentration, Touch, Personal

For the duration of the spell, the recipient is entirely invisible to sight. They can still be heard, felt or smelled, with a -20% to Perception tests. Also, if the caster loses concentration, or the recipient casts a spell or makes an attack, the spell ends. The recipient also becomes visible immediately after the spell ends, so even if the caster immediately casts another Invisibility spell, there will be a delay between castings where the recipient is visible.

### Jigsaw

Duration 6 Hours, Magnitude 4, Non-variable

This spell causes the target to fall to pieces upon a failed Persistence roll. The victim will still be alive but will not require food or water during the time the spell is in operation. When the spell ends, due to being dispelled or running out of duration, the victim will die unless painstakingly put back together beforehand.

### Lightning Strike

Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Dodge)

This spell causes a sizzling bolt of lightning to streak from the hand of the caster toward the target. If the bolt hits, each point of magnitude of the spell will cause 1D6 damage. Armour Points are not effective against this damage, and it counts as both magical and electrical damage.

### Madness

Instant, Magnitude 1, Non-variable, Ranged, Resist (Persistence, see below)

This spell causes the target to lose contact with reality and become a gibbering loon. Madness does not affect unconscious targets, those without an INT Characteristic or those that are already under the effect of a Madness spell.

***Madness Effects***

| Target's Persistence Test | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Target fumbles Persistence test | Victim instantly loses 1D4 INT permanently and lapses into a catatonic state for minutes equal to 20 minus its POW (minimum of one combat round). |
| Target fails Persistence test | Victim gibbers and raves uncontrollably for combat rounds equal to 20 minus its POW (minimum of one combat round). The victim will perform random combat actions during this period. Roll 1D6.Move to close combat attack a random target. Run in a random direction (Roll 1D12 as clock face to determine direction). Cast a spell at a random target.Use ranged attack against a random target. Shout at a random target. Change stance. |
| Target succeeds Persistence test | The victim is shaken and disturbed, suffering a –20% penalty to all skill tests for combat rounds equal to 20 minus its POW (minimum of one combat round). |
| Target critically succeeds Persistence test | The victim is unaffected by the spell and cannot be affected by further Madness spells for combat rounds equal to its POW. |

### Mindblast

Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

This spell applies a penalty to the victim's INT equal to the magnitude of the spell. The effect lasts days equal to the Caster's current CHA.

### Mindlink

Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell allows the transmission of conscious thoughts, spell knowledge, runes and magic points between participants.

Additional points of magnitude allow multiple sets of people to be linked together, either creating several separate pairs of Mindlinked people or making the Caster the central hub of a small Mindlink network. In the second case, only the 'central' character is linked directly to other participants.

Mindlink must be cast upon all participants at the same time and is limited to consenting participants. Any participant in a Mindlink may use the spell knowledge and magic points of others they linked to without consent.

Participants in a Mindlink have a special vulnerability to INT, POW, CHA and morale-affecting spells. Such a spell cast against any member of a Mindlink will affect all those connected, though all participants are entitled to defend themselves individually.

Although participants in a Mindlink share magic points and conscious thought, they remain their own entity. Mindlink does not include hidden thoughts, memories, unconscious urges or permanent spell knowledge. A Mindlink participant may cast a spell using one of those the other participants have, but only if they have the necessary spell casting skill – Mindlink does not allow sharing of skills.

Any participant may sever their connection to the Mindlink as a combat action. If any participant in Mindlink leaves the spell's range, that participant has left the Mindlink.

### Miraculous Item

Duration 1 hour, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell allows the Caster to create items literally from nowhere. The size of the item depends upon the magnitude of the spell.

***Magnitude vs. Size of Miraculous Item***

| Magnitude | Size of item |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Small items. Such as pots, plates, knives, and a defaced detail on a stone fresco, etc. |
| 2 | Medium. Large containers such as wine amphorae, target shields, long swords, human-sized armour, a missing arm on a broken statue. |
| 3 | Large. Tower shields, broken doors, a missing masonry feature such as a column. |
| 4 | Huge. Giant armour, ruined houses, shattered towers. |
| 5 | Enormous. The broken parts of a walking castle, the ruined walls of a city. |

Such items are always of the finest quality and do not break under any circumstance. For the cost of the magnitude in growth points, the item can last permanently. Otherwise, it disappears after one hour.

### Mythic Journey

Common, Duration 1 Day, Magnitude 4, Non-variable

This spell opens a gate to a place in the Houses of the Holy associated most closely with the worshipper's deity or pantheon. The worshipper may take any number of companions with them but must be aware that if they are not acceptable to the residents of the place they are going to, they may be attacked or expelled. Also, the companions must have some strong spiritual connection with the caster, such as being members of the same religion or good friends.

Time works differently in the worlds of mythology, perhaps no longer being a workable concept, but for where time is important, in the Real World, the spell's duration is the amount of time that the caster and their companions are away in the Mythic World.

_For example,_ Ethelred uses this spell to travel to the Palace of the Celestial Emperor to ask him in person for help in the Real World against the invading Burning Horde. Once his business has finished there, he decides to stay and linger enjoying the delights of the Divine Court. Months pass, or so it seems, until Ethelred loses track of how many Imperial Banquets he has enjoyed. One morning, instead of waking up in his crystal room with its bed made of satin sheets, in the palace, he awakes in the Real World Temple of the Celestial Emperor in one of the initiates beds, a rather rude affair with rougher linen sheets. He asks the passing novice how long he has been away and finds out that it's only a day after he passed through the gate when he cast the spell.

It is also possible to get trapped in the Mythic World (for example, through getting captured by magical powers) in which case the character does not return form the Mythic World until they escape whatever power that has them in their thrall.

_For example,_ Nykos the Squire accompanies Ethelred to the Palace of the Celestial Emperor. While his master is conducting his business, Nykos meets one of the Imperial Handmaidens and becomes beguiled by her charms. When Ethelred returns to the real world, after months of pleasure, Nykos remains still under the spell of the Imperial Handmaiden.

### Mischief

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Touch, Resist (Persistence)

Mischief is a minor trickster's spell which afflicts its target with a small irritating curse.

Roll 1D20 on the following list for a result, which stays in place for the duration of the spell.

***Type of Mischief***

| Roll 1D20 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Clothes disappear. |
| 2 | Hair goes green. |
| 3 | Hair drops out. |
| 4 | Grows beard regardless of sex. |
| 5 | The target's weapon becomes a bunch of flowers. |
| 6 | Armour becomes the festive dress of the opposite sex. |
| 7 | Feet become duck feet. |
| 8 | Head becomes that of a domestic animal (cow, pig, sheep, etc.). |
| 9 | Victim smells of excrement (-20% to any Deception or Influence rolls). |
| 10 | Wobbles uncontrollably, -20% to attacks, Athletics and any other roll involving dexterity. |
| 11 | The victim can only speak gibberish. |
| 12 | The victim says the most inappropriate things at the most socially awkward times. -20% to any Influence rolls. |
| 13 | The victim falls asleep for 1D6 rounds on failed Persistence roll whenever they enter combat. |
| 14 | Makes loud flatulent noises whenever they move; -25 to any Deception rolls. |
| 15 | The victim is compelled to tell the truth at all times. |
| 16 | No one ever takes the character seriously. Always has to make an Influence roll at -20% to convince others. |
| 17 | Turns into a dog. |
| 18 | Arms turn to rubber, unable to hold anything. |
| 19 | The victim becomes short, half SIZ. |
| 20 | Roll twice. |

### Puppet

Concentration, Duration 6 hours, Magnitude 3, Resist (Persistence)

The caster uses this spell to enchant a puppet, which is the focus of the spell and the stand-in for the victim. The victim can use Persistence to resist the spell, and if they fail, their actions are controlled via the puppet by the caster, for the duration of the spell. The victim is aware of not being in control of their body but is powerless to stop it. The exception to this rule is when the victim's life or that of a friend is in danger because of the Puppeteer's commands. Then the victim is allowed another Persistence roll, and, if successful, break free of the spell's control.

### Purity (Religion/Creed)

Magnitude 2, Touch

This spell removes a perceived sin according to a particular religion. If the caster is out of favour because of said sin, all is forgotten and forgiven.

### Quicksand

Area, Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

This spell creates a patch of quicksand 10m square. The earth in the area becomes boggy and saturated with water. On a failed Persistence roll, any character standing on the patch will sink into the earth, at a rate of 1 metre a combat round, The quicksand holds the victim firmly and only by dispelling the magic can they be rescued.

Once the duration of the spell is over, the victim, if not on the surface, is buried under the now solid earth (see Suffocation rules).

### Radiant Appearance

Duration 1 Day, Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

The recipient of this spell glows with light and power. They gain +50% to any Influence rolls for the duration of the spell. Also, any light-hating creatures suffer -20% when attacking the recipient.

### Repair and Replace

Instant, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell repairs broken crafted items. It also replaces missing parts of an item.

The size of the item depends on the magnitude of the spell.

***Size of Item vs Magnitude***

| Magnitude | Size of Item |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Small items, such as pots, plates, knives, a defaced detail on a stone fresco, etc. |
| 2 | Medium. Large containers, such as wine amphorae, target shields, long swords, human-sized armour, a missing arm on a broken statue. |
| 3 | Large. Tower shields, broken doors, a missing masonry feature such as a column. |
| 4 | Huge. Giant armour, ruined houses, shattered towers. |
| 5 | Enormous. The broken parts of a walking castle, the ruined walls of a city. |

### Reflection

Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Ranged

This spell reflects incoming spells aimed at the target or his equipment, redirecting the spell back at the original caster. Once cast on a subject, Reflection will attempt to reflect any spells cast at the target. It will not have any effect on spells that are already affecting a character. The effects of Reflection depend on the relative magnitude of both itself and the incoming spell – see the Reflection Results table for more details.

Reflection is incompatible with Absorption, Shield and Spirit Block

***Reflection Results***

| Incoming Spell's Magnitude is. . . | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Equal to or weaker than Reflection's magnitude. | Incoming spell reflected and Reflection remains. |
| 1 or more points stronger than Reflection's magnitude. | Reflection eliminated and incoming spell takes effect. |

### Resurrect

Concentration Special, Instant, Magnitude 5, Non-variable, Touch

The body of the deceased must be present and must be whole. If the target died due to disease or poison, the recipient returns to life cured.

This spell summons the deceased spirit to return its former body. Taking minutes equal to the target's totalled Characteristics to take effect, during which time the caster must maintain concentration on the spell. If interrupted, the spell fails. When the spell is successful, the dead character returns to life with one hit point.

Resurrect must be cast within days equal to the POW of the deceased. Casting the spell after this point results in the magic automatically failing.

### Rout

Magnitude 3, Non-variable

When aimed at a body of warriors, of no more than one hundred persons, they must make a Persistence roll or immediately lose all cohesion as a unit and rout. Routing units move at double movement, away from the caster, to ideally a place of safety. They will not defend themselves but will attack any enemy units that get in their way, to get through them to their place of safety.

### See Past

Area, Concentration, Magnitude 2, Non-variable

When cast on a 10m area, the caster, as long as they concentrate, can see the area as it was in any past point of time they wish. They still need to make successful Perception rolls to notice details, such as important clues, and they cannot interact with the scene they see in any way, shape or form.

### Shield

Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Progressive

This spell protects the caster from physical and magical attacks. Each point of magnitude gives the caster one Armour Point and provides a +10% bonus to any tests the caster may make to resist malign magical effects. A magnitude 4 Shield spell provides the caster with +4 AP and a +40% bonus against malign spells, for instance. These effects are cumulative with other spells, as well as any physical armour the caster is wearing. Shield is incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and Spirit Block.

### Soul Sight

Common, Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Non-variable, Touch

This spell allows the recipient to see the POW aura of anyone they looks at, enabling them to discern that creature's current magic points, as well as the nature of any active spells or enchanted items the creature is carrying. It also allows the recipient to see into the Spirit World.

### Stink Bomb

Magnitude 1, Resist (Resilience)

Upon being targeted by this spell, the victim becomes covered in a tightly fitting cloak of noxious smelling gas for 1D6 rounds. Each round the victim must make a Resilience test or take 1D4 damage. If the resistance test result is a fumbled, the character is unconscious for the remaining duration of the spell from being knocked out by the smell. All Influence tests and other social interactions are at -20% for the duration of the spell.

### Spirit Block

Common, Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Progressive, Touch

Spirits may only touch the recipient of Spirit Block with a POW high enough to break through the spell's magnitude (see table).

***Spirit Block Effectiveness***

| Spirit Block's Magnitude | Recipient May Only Be Harmed By Spirits With… |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | POW 10 or higher |
| 2 | POW 17 or higher |
| 3 | POW 26 or higher |
| 4 | POW 37 or higher |
| 5 | POW 50 or higher |
| 6 | POW 65 or higher |
| 7 | POW 82 or higher |
| 8 | POW 101 or higher |

A spirit unable to touch a Spirit Blocked character will not be able to personally attack or harm the recipient, including through ranged attacks (such as a thrown spectral javelin). A spell cast by a spirit at the recipient is blocked unless its magnitude exceeds Spirit Block's magnitude.

Spirit Block is incompatible with Absorption, Reflection and Shield.

### Sun Disc

Magnitude 1, Non-variable, Ranged, Resist (Dodge)

Upon casting this spell, the Caster projects a disc of blinding light from their hand. Targets in the path of the disc are blinded for 1D4 hours, unless they pass their Dodge skill test. Its warming effect melts ice upon contact, even magical ice, if under three magnitude in power, and gives anyone it touches +50% resistance versus cold.

### Sunspear

Instant, Magnitude 4, Non-variable, Ranged, Resist (Dodge)

This spell will only function in direct sunlight. When cast, a shaft of light two metres wide streaks from the sky to blast a single target, who must be visible to the caster. If the target does not dive out of the way, the blazing light will burn it for 4D6 damage. Armour points are not effective against this damage, and it counts as both magical and fire damage.

### Sureshot

Duration 15, Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Ranged

When cast on a missile weapon (such as a knife, arrow, javelin or rock), firing it triggers the spell. Unless the wielder of the weapon rolls an automatic failure or a fumble, the missile hits successfully (though it may be dodged or parried). So long as the target is within the maximum range of the weapon, the missile will strike home, regardless of concealment or any other factors. Attempts to parry or dodge the missile suffer a –20% penalty.

Combining Sureshot with Firearrow, Multimissile or Speedart does not work, since Sureshot will always take precedence in such cases.

### Thunder's Voice

Magnitude 2, Non-variable

This spell grants the caster a loud voice of command which gives the caster +20% added to their Influence skill, heard at up to 200 metres.

### Touch of Death

Magnitude 4, Non-variable, Touch, Instant, Resist (Persistence)

The caster must touch their victim, and on a failed Persistence test, the victim falls dead. This incredibly powerful spell is available to only members of religions whose deity wields the power of death itself. Usually, to redress the balance, where a person who by all rights should be dead is still alive.

### Treasury

Duration 1-day Magnitude 4

This spell creates a secure room, for one day, to store valuables. All the entrances are locked and only the caster can come in and out without setting off a magical alarm that they can hear, no matter how far away from the room they are.

### True (Weapon)

Duration 15 minutes, Magnitude 3 Non-variable, Ranged

When cast on the specified type of weapon, this spell doubles that weapon's normal damage dice. Other modifiers, such as Damage Modifier, are not affected. The wielder of the weapon should roll the weapon's damage twice and total the result.

### Ward Camp

Area, Duration eight hours, Magnitude 2, Non-variable

This spell protects a camp with an area of 50 meters squared. Anyone crossing the invisible boundary of the spell takes 1D10 damage and sets off a magical alarm that immediately awakens everyone within the camp. The Ward stays in place, even after it has been crossed, for the full duration of the spell.

### Wax Effigy

Magnitude 4, Non-variable, Resist (Persistence)

This spell enchants a small wax representation of the intended victim. Spells can be cast at the effigy and affect the victim, despite the distance between the effigy and the victim. The caster need not have seen/met the victim, since it is the power of their god that is providing the link. Once a day, the victim can be caused physical harm by driving pins into the effigy, at 1D4 damage per pin. The caster can attempt to kill the victim outright by breaking off the head of the effigy. In this case, the victim gets a Persistence roll to avoid death. On a failed Persistence test, the victim dies. On a successful Persistence roll, the effigy no longer has any power over the victim.

### Whirlwind

Magnitude 1, Duration 15 minutes, Progressive

Each point of magnitude of this spell whips up a whirlwind capable of carrying 20 SIZ in its whirling vortex. Each round the whirlwind moves ten metres per point, in a random direction (use a D8 to determine the direction, with 1 being North and 5 being South, progressing clockwise around the directions). For each point of magnitude the whirlwind is 10 metres tall.

If the whirlwind hits a character, make a Dodge roll to avoid being caught up in it. Characters caught are whipped off their feet, 1D6 metres into the vortex. Each round roll a 1D6 and consult the following table.

***Whirlwind Results***

| Roll 1D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | The character is carried up 1D10 metres (if already at the top, blown out of the whirlwind the additional height before falling to earth (taking damage). |
| 3-4 | Stay at the height they are. |
| 5-6 | Fall 1D6 down in the vortex. If this takes them to the ground, they take falling damage. |

# OQ3 SRD Sorcery

## Types of Sorcerer

Practitioners of Sorcery develop in one of two ways. The majority of sorcerers belong to schools of sorcery, which have books of spells and rules that they teach their apprentices. Alternatively, there is a long tradition of practitioners working in solitude, cut off from other Sorcerers and society at large, to focus purely on their magical activities. Occasionally such solitary Sorcerers take on an apprentice, to teach their art to, or simply as a helping hand around the magical laboratory.

### Example School: The University of Wizardry

_Benefits:_ Free board and lodging at all University Hostelries and forts.

_For an Adept or Magus_

Rescue or ransom will be paid if captured.

_Duties:_ Uphold the laws of the University.

Oppose and expose heretical sorcerers.

_Sorcery taught:_ Animate (Substance), Cast Back, Create Spell Matrix, Create Scroll, Damage Boosting, Damage Resistance, Dominate (Orc), Dominate (Goblin), Energy Projection (Fire), Enhance (STR), Enhance (DEX), Mystic Vision, Neutralise Magic, Palsy, Protective Sphere, Sight Projection, Spell Resistance, Summon (Magic Spirit), Treat Wounds.

_Prohibited Magic:_ Tap (characteristic), Summon Demon or Undead, Venom.

### Example Solo Sorcerer. The Sorcerer who Lives in the Tower

This is an Adept close to becoming a Magus (he has Sorcery Casting 85% and needs 95%), who lives in an isolated village on the border. He lives in an old ruined tower, just outside the village, conducting magical experiments and ensuring the safety of the village from 'Things from Beyond'. Most of the villagers think he is a mad fool, but are not beyond seeking out his services, of healing and exorcism, when beset by the strange magical horrors

_Sorcery Spells known:_ Cast Back, Create Spell Matrix, Create Scroll, Damage Boosting, Damage Resistance, Diminish (SIZ), Dominate (Spirit), Energy Projection (Cold), Fly, Mirage, Neutralise Magic, Protective Sphere, Shape change (Man) to (Wolf), Skin of Life, Spell Resistance, Spirit Resistance, Summon Elemental, Summon Spirit, Treat wounds.

_Prohibited Magic: Tap (characteristic), Venom._

## Ranks of Sorcery

There are three basic ranks of Sorcerers.

_Apprentices_ (Sorcery Casting 25% and up). Those who are learning the laws of Sorcery and their application.

_Adepts_ (minimum of Sorcery Casting 50%). Those who have a firm grasp of the basics and are making firm progress towards the true pinnacle of achievement.

_Magus_ (minimum of Sorcery Casting 90%). Those who have mastered the arts of Sorcery and have used its power to transcend the limitations of life itself.

### Apprentices

These are students of Sorcery who will only know a couple of spells, including Mystic Vision. As well as being taught the arts of Sorcery via book learning, attending practical classes or conducting practical fieldwork that their masters consider the foundations of their learning, they also spend a large amount of their time doing drudge work, cleaning up, doing the heavy lifting and other physical tasks that their teachers consider themselves above.

_Requirements:_ To become an Apprentice, as well as meeting the Sorcery Casting requirement of a minimum skill of 25%, the character must spend two growth points.

_Benefits:_ Apprentices learn the spell Mystic Vision, which is the fundamental method of discerning the Laws of Sorcery in action, for free, and they are shown how to create a sorcerer's wand.

#### The Sorcerer's Wand

The classic wand is a slender rod of hardwood about the length of the owner's forearm. The wand is created for the apprentice by their mentor, who enchants the wand for the new apprentice.

The wand focuses up to two spells that the character knows. These spells can be changed in the downtime between adventures, and have a star placed against the spell name on the character sheet to show they are focused. Spells that are focused by the wand increase the character's Sorcery Casting skill when casting them with the wand (+20% when used to all casting tests).

The character is aware of where the wand is at all times and the enchantments placed upon the wand makes it indestructible.

### Adepts

These are full graduates of the schools of Sorcery, or equivalent, taught by a solo sorcerer who acknowledges their autonomy and ability to practice Sorcery without constant supervision. They will know between five and ten spells and will have a Sorcery Casting skill ranging from 50% to 90%. If a member of a school of Sorcery, they will be expected to spend 30% of their time performing duties for the school, such as teaching apprentices or recovering lost magical knowledge. If a former apprentice of a solo sorcerer, they will probably start taking over whatever duties their mentor is giving up (due to old age or deepening studies towards becoming a Magus).

_Requirements:_ To become an Adept the character must have a minimum of 50% in Sorcery Casting, a POW of at least 15 and know at least five spells.

#### Benefits of becoming an Adept

#### The Sorcerer's Stone

Would-be Adepts know how to create their sorcerer's stone when they reach Sorcery Casting of 50%, and do so as part of the ceremony where they rise to Adepthood.

The sorcerer's stone takes the form of a large magic crystal, about the size of a fist, which is primarily a magic point store. It can store up to the character's current POW in magic points.

#### The Sorcerer's Staff

Sorcerers of Adept rank are more active in the Real World and spend more time travelling around. So, they need a more obvious symbol of their power than the small and slender wand. Therefore, every Adept creates a sorcerer's staff when they rise to this rank.

- It acts as a spell focus, like a wand, but it's not limited to two spells – the staff focuses one spell per ten points of Sorcery Casting.
- Any spells that are focused by the character's wand may also be focused on by the staff. Many Adepts keep their wands and use them for magic casting at home.
- Like the wand, the staff is indestructible, and the sorcerer knows where it is at all times.
- The sorcerer may mount their sorcerer's stone at the end of the staff.
- Finally, the staff is two-handed and can be used in close combat doing 1D10 damage.

#### The Sorcerer's Familiar

Upon becoming an Adept, Sorcerers may also create a familiar from a standard animal.

Use an animal as a template for stats.

- The familiar is in permanent Mindlink with the sorcerer, with a range as determined by the sorcerer's Range Magnitude.
- Part of the ritual to create the familiar awakens its Intelligence, which becomes equal to the sorcerer's INT.
- A familiar's characteristics, skills and magic can be increased by the player spending growth points, as they would for the character.
- The player of the sorcerer who created the familiar also runs the familiar.
- If killed, all the growth points that went towards creating and improving the familiar return to the character's pool of unspent growth points.

#### Create and Teach Apprentice

Adepts can perform the rituals and create wands to induct Apprentices into the art of Sorcery. They can then teach them Sorcery spells.

Sorcerers do not teach non-sorcerers Sorcery. Instead, would-be students need to become Apprentices and learn the fundamental principles.

### Magus

A Magus is an acknowledged master of Sorcery. They have at least ten spells and a Sorcery Casting skill of 90%+. If a character meets these requirements, the player can spend ten growth points to gain this rank. If a member of a school of Sorcery, the magus serves on its ruling body and has the complete resources of the school at their command. In return, they spend 90% of their time researching, teaching, and performing missions on the school's behalf.

#### Transcendence

The Magus has such high knowledge of the laws of Sorcery that they are no longer part of the Real World. Their body changes from a physical one, based upon CON and SIZ with hit points, to one based on pure magical energy, based upon POW and magic points.

Consequently, they are immune to disease and poison, unless they specifically target POW or magic points, and instead of taking damage to hit points, they take them to magic points.

Spells which heal a physical body, such as Heal, Treat Wounds, and Divine Heal, do not work on the Magus' new magical form. Instead, a Magus will transfer stored magic points, such as those held in their Sorcerer's Stone, back into their magical body. This takes one combat round and is an action that requires full concentration to complete.

Defensive spells that protect against physical harm, such as Damage Resistance, still do so. As does physical armour, although a Magus is more likely to use magical means to protect themselves.

The appearance of their new magical body takes the form of the Magus at their most ideal. This form has a glowing halo around it, which is obvious to any onlooker.

The character no longer ages physically and is considered immortal.

Since they are made of pure magical energy, they also are easily detectable using Find Magic and other magic detection spells.

For many player characters, Transcending is the end of their story in-game, with the player retiring the character from play. If the player has ideas of how the Transcended character can continue, they should discuss that with their Referee to work out further adventures. Most non-player character Transcended Masters choose to withdraw from the Real World, using their new magical body to explore Other Worlds and the other avenues of magical power that open up to them. They often maintain a link with the Real World, where favoured students can contact them for sentimental reasons.

***Ranks of Sorcery***

| Rank | Minimum Sorcery Casting | Minimum number of Spells | Growth cost | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Apprentice | 25% | 0 | 1 | Taught Sorcery spells. Taught Mystic Vision for free.Gifted a sorcerer's wand. |
| Adept | 50% | 5 | 5 | Learns Sorcery spells.Creates a sorcerer's staff.Creates a sorcerer's stone.May create a familiar. May create and teach Apprentices. |
| Magus | 90% | 10 | 10 | Learns Sorcery spells.Achieves Transcendence. |

## Learning Sorcery

Before a spell can be cast using Sorcery, the following process must be followed:

The character must first learn the spell through research. To learn a particular Sorcery spell, the caster must possess the spell in written form or be taught it by a teacher. The player then spends three Growth points and writes the spell down on their character sheet.

The Sorcery Casting magical skill governs each Sorcery spell. This skill is automatically acquired at its basic score (INT) when the character is first created. This skill may be improved normally, through the use of growth points. Even non-sorcerers have this skill, at its base value, since it is used to give them a chance to use sorcerous magic items and scrolls that store Sorcery spells.

Once the Sorcery spell has been learned, the character will be ready to try casting it.

## Conversion to Sorcery

This procedure affects characters who are Personal Magic and Divine Magic users who want to learn Sorcery.

Sorcery is not a compatible philosophy with Personal Magic or Divine Magic. Personal Magic is a haphazard set of techniques, and anyone becoming an Apprentice must give it up. Likewise, the allied magician type of Shaman or Wise. Similarly, Divine Magic is the passionate and faith-based belief in the power of the gods, which has no place alongside the rationality of Sorcery which believes that gods are merely thought-forms given power by their worshippers.

When a character who possesses either Divine or Personal Magic wants to learn Sorcery, they convert to Sorcery's world view on how magic works. They unlearn any Divine or Personal Magic spells that they know, spending the freed up growth points to learn new spells, advance Sorcery Casting and to pay for any advancement in Rank in Sorcery.

## Casting Sorcery Spells

A character must be able to gesture with their hands and be able to chant to cast a spell. Whenever a spell is cast using Sorcery, there will always be a sight and sound that nearby creatures can detect, be it a flash of light, a crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air. The exact effects are up to the Referee and player to decide, but they will automatically be seen and heard by any creatures within ten times the magnitude of the spell in metres.

If casting a Sorcery spell in a stressful situation, like in the middle of combat or if the Sorcerer is casting it as an on-the-spot reaction to a dangerous situation, requires a successful skill test using the Sorcery Casting skill. If successful, the spell takes effect. Like other skill use, if the sorcerer is casting the spell in a calm situation, away from danger, then the spell does not require a Sorcery Casting test.

If the casting test fails, the spell does not take effect, and the caster loses one magic point.

The only thing a character can do while casting a spell is walk up to half their movement rate.

A spell takes effect at the end of its casting, which starts at the beginning of the combat round and ends on the Sorcery Casting skill of the caster in the combat order. Note, while spell casting a character will draw possible attacks from enemies that are adjacent to them during a combat round.

Distractions or attacks on the sorcerer as they cast will require Persistence tests for them to maintain concentration on the spell.

### Magic Points

All Sorcery spells cost a base of one magic point to cast. If a manipulated, each effect costs extra magic points to apply.

### Casting Critical Successes

If a Sorcery Casting test results in a critical success, then any attempts to resist or counter the spell suffer a –25% penalty and the magic point cost for applying any manipulation effect costs nothing.

### Casting Fumbles

If a Sorcery Casting test results in a fumble, then the spell fails and the Sorcerer loses the full cost of the spell, including manipulation effects, as if it had been successfully cast.

### Manipulation of Sorcery Spells

Sorcery spells have three basic effects which can be manipulated by the sorcerer: magnitude, duration and range.

Each effect has a default value which the spell can be cast at, costing one magic point. The Manipulation table gives the default value for the spell effects.

Before the spell casting, the player decides which effects to manipulate and works out the extra magic point cost.

***Manipulation cost***

| Sorcery Skill % | Magic Point cost | Magnitude | Duration | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any (Default traits) | 1 | 1 | 5 minutes | 10 m |
| 01-10% | +1 | 2 | 15 minutes | 20 m |
| 11-20% | +2 | 3 | 1 hour | 50 m |
| 21-30% | +3 | 4 | 6 hours | 250 m |
| 31-40% | +4 | 5 | 12 hours | 500m |
| 41-50% | +5 | 6 | 1 day | 1 km |
| 51-60% | +6 | 7 | 1 week | 10 km |
| 61-70% | +7 | 8 | 1 month | 100 km |
| 71-80% | +8 | 9 | 1 season | 1000 km |
| 81-90% | +9 | 10 | 1 year | 5000 km |
| 91-99% | +10 | 15 | 5 Years | 10,000 km |
| 100% | +10 | 20 | Permanent | Planetary |

#### Where do Sorcerers get all the Magic Points they Need for Manipulated Spells?

A sorcerer can cast a spell which needs more magic points in its manipulated form than a sorcerer will normally have. Sorcerers get round this by storing magic points in their Sorcerer's Stone or using bound Magic Spirits (through a combination of Summon Magic Spirit, then Dominate Magic Spirit) to provide magic points.

#### Can Spells be Further Manipulated Once Cast?

No. Once you've cast a particular spell on a particular recipient it stays in place until dispelled, by either the caster (at will) or an opponent casting some sort of dispel magic spell, such as Neutralise Magic. Neither the original caster or another Sorcerer can go back and add more magic points to increase its magnitude, range or duration further.

#### Masters and Manipulation

As you can see from the table above, once a Sorcerer gets to 100% casting the manipulation effects suddenly go off the charts. This reflects the fact that Masters are so in tune with the magical flow of the Universe that they are almost godlike in their ability to bend the Universe to their will.

## Spell Traits

The traits used by Sorcery spells are detailed below.

_Concentration:_ The spell's effects will remain in place as long as the character concentrates on it. Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the spell caster to continue to gesture with both arms, chant and to ignore distractions. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default duration.

_Instant:_ The spell's effects take place instantly. The spell itself then disappears. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default duration.

_Permanent:_ The spell's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default duration.

_Resist (Dodge/Persistence/Resilience):_ The spell's effects do not take effect automatically. The target may make a Dodge, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Dodge) spells require the target to be able to use Reactions to Dodge. In the case of Area spells, the Resist (Dodge) trait requires the target to dive to mitigate the spell's effect.

_Touch:_ These spells require the character to actually touch their target for the spell to take effect. The spell caster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default range.

**Defaults**

Sorcery spells tend to have far fewer traits than other types of magic. This is because most Sorcery spells share the same basic qualities: A duration equal to 5 minutes, a magnitude of 1, a range equal to 10 metres, and the default Sorcery spell will only affect one target.

## Spell Descriptions

### Animate (Substance)

Concentration

This spell allows the sorcerer to animate the substance indicated, up to one SIZ for every point of magnitude. The sorcerer can cause it to move about and interact, albeit relatively clumsily (Movement of 1m per three points of magnitude).

The sorcerer's chance to have the animated object perform any physical skill successfully is equal to half their own chance to perform that action (before any modifiers). If the appropriate Form/Set spell is cast immediately after this spell, the caster can perform much finer manipulation of the object. In this case, the animated object will use the caster's full skill scores for physical activities.

This spell can only be used on inanimate matter.

### Cast Back

This protective spell shields the caster from hostile magic and has a chance of sending it back to the attacking spell caster.

Cast Back only affects spells that target the user specifically and have the Resist trait. Such spells may affect the protected character normally, but if it is resisted, the spell is launched back at the person who cast it, as long as its magnitude is not greater than the Cast Back's magnitude.

### Create Godform (Deity)

Touch

This spell can be cast on a recipient other than the caster. It allows the recipient to assume the magical form of the deity for the duration of the spell. While not quite the same as becoming the god itself, it allows the recipient to assume some of the powers of the deity.

While the spell is in operation, the recipient gains:

+20% in all the skills that the deity teaches.

Each magnitude of the spell beyond the first allows the recipient to learn and cast one point of the deity's Divine or Personal Magic for the duration of the spell. Divine Magic is one use, and Personal Magic must be paid for from the recipients' magic points.

The recipient knows anything the deity would know.

This is an exceptionally powerful spell, whose use and knowledge automatically puts the sorcerer on the enemy list of the deity's cult, should they find out that the sorcerer knows how to Godform their god.

If the spell is fumbled, one of the following events, or one similar from the Referee's fertile imagination, occurs:

The deity sends one of its guardians, an Otherworld servant, to exact divine vengeance upon the sorcerer.

The deity transports the sorcerer and all 'helpers' to their court in the Houses of the Holy to explain themselves.

The deity tells a local priest of the sorcerer's heresy and makes it clear that it is their temple's job to exact revenge on their deity's behalf.

### Damage Boosting

Touch

This spell can be cast upon any weapon up to 5 ENC. Each point of magnitude adds one point to the weapon's damage (e.g. the basic spell will increase a hatchet from 1D6 damage to 1D6+1 damage).

### Damage Resistance

Touch

This spell protects the body of the recipient. Any incoming attack dealing damage equal to or less than the magnitude of the spell is ignored. Any incoming attack dealing more damage than the magnitude of Damage Resistance is unaffected and will deal its full damage as normal. Note, the protected character may still suffer from Knockback if applicable.

Damage Resistance may be combined with the Divine Magic spell Shield, in which case incoming damage is compared to the Damage Resistance spell first and only encounters the Shield spell if the Damage Resistance is bypassed.

### Diminish (characteristic)

Resist (Persistence/Resilience), Touch

There are seven Diminish spells, one for each characteristic. The spell will temporarily apply a penalty to the specified characteristic equal to the magnitude of the spell. The penalty applied by this spell may not reduce a characteristic below one, and a creature must have the characteristic in question to be affected by this spell.

Diminish (STR, DEX, CON and SIZ) are resisted with Resilience. Diminish (INT, POW and CHA) are resisted with Persistence.

Applying a penalty to POW does not reduce the character's magic points.

Note that not all uses of this spell are malicious. Thieves and others often value the timely use of a Diminish (SIZ) spell, as it can greatly enhance their ability to enter restricted areas.

### Dominate (Species)

Resist (Persistence)

This spell allows the caster to gain control over a creature belonging to a specific species. If the target fails to resist the spell, it must obey the commands of the caster for the duration of the spell.

The controlled creature shares a telepathic link with the sorcerer by which it can receive its orders. If the sorcerer and the creature dominated do not share a common language, the sorcerer can order it about, by forming a mental image of the actions they wish the dominated creature to perform.

### Energy Projection (Type)

Ranged, Instant, Resist (Dodge)
 Energy is either projected as a beam or a ball towards the target, who can avoid the attack by Dodging.

If the spell takes effect, the target takes damage equal to double the magnitude of the spell. Physical armour does not protect against the damage, but magical protection does. Types of energy that can be projected by this spell are Cold (Dark), Lightning, Heat (Fire), Shards of Rock (Earth), Windblast (Air).

### Enhance (characteristic)

Touch

There are seven Enhance spells, one for each characteristic. Essentially the reverse of the Diminish spell, Enhance allows the Sorcerer to temporarily apply a bonus to the specified characteristic equal to the magnitude of the spell. A creature must have the characteristic in question to be affected by this spell.

Applying a bonus to POW does not increase the character's magic points.

### Fly

Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

Using this spell allows the caster (or whomever or whatever they target with the spell) to fly. The caster may levitate objects or characters (the caster counting as one of these characters if they so wish).

A levitated character may not be overloaded and must have a SIZ characteristic which is lower than the sorcerer's POW characteristic.

Objects must have an ENC lower than the sorcerer's POW characteristic.

Character or objects moved by this spell have a base Movement Rate of 6m. All objects and characters moved by this spell move at the spell caster's behest, not their own.

Each point of the spell's magnitude may either be used to increase the target's Movement by +2m or to target an additional object or character – but not both. A sorcerer casting this spell at magnitude 4 may fly themselves with a Movement of 14m, fly themselves and a friend with a Movement of 10m each, or fly themselves and three friends with a Movement of 6m each.

### Form/Set (Substance)

Instant

There is an unlimited number of Form/Set spells in existence, one for every substance imaginable, from steel to smoke to water.

Each point of magnitude allows the caster to shape one ENC of solid substance or one cubic metre of an ethereal substance (like darkness). The caster must be familiar with the shape they are forming.

When the caster has finished the forming process, the substance retains its shape. Rigid substances like steel will hold the form they had at the end of the spell, while more mutable substances like water will immediately lose their shape.

This spell can be used to mend the damage done to an object. The sorcerer must form the entire object and must succeed at an appropriate Craft test. If successful they will restore the item to its original condition.

This spell can only be used on inanimate substances.

### Glow

This spell causes a glowing point of light to appear on a solid substance. At its base, the spell creates an area of light one metre in radius, giving off the same illumination as a candle. Each additional point of magnitude increases the radius of effect by one metre. At magnitude 3, the brightness of the spell increases to that of a flaming brand at its centre. At magnitude 5, it increases to that of a camp-fire and at magnitude 10 to that of a bonfire.

This spell can be cast on an opponent's eyes. If cast on a living being, the spell also gains the Resist (Dodge) trait. If the target fails to resist it, they will suffer a penalty to all attack, parry and Dodge tests, as well as any skills relying upon vision, equal to five times the spell's magnitude, until the spell ends or is dispelled.

### Hamper

Resist (Resilience)

Each point of magnitude of Hamper subtracts 1m from the Movement rate of the target. Every two points of magnitude also subtract -10% from a recipient's skills for the purposes of determining the order in combat.

### Haste

Each point of magnitude of Haste adds 1m to the Movement rate of the recipient. Every two points of magnitude also add +10% to the recipient's skills for the purposes of determining the order in combat.

### Holdfast

Touch

This spell causes two adjacent ten centimetres by ten centimetre surfaces (roughly the size of a person's palm) to commingle into one. The basic bond has a STR of 1. Each additional point of magnitude will either increase the STR of the bond by +1 or double the area affected.

This spell can affect organic and inorganic substances. If the caster is attempting to bond a living being with this spell, the spell gains the Resist (Resilience) trait.

### Make Potion

Permanent

Using the arts of alchemy, Sorcerers can store Sorcery spells in a liquid known as a Potion.

All potions have an attached cost of 1 Gold Ducat per magnitude of spell in ingredients. Multiple spells may be stored in one potion, with the understanding that they will all be cast when the potion is drunk at the magnitude that the creator originally put into the potion.

### Make Scroll

Permanent

Magical scrolls are written items that store Sorcery spells. All scrolls have an attached cost of 1 Gold Ducat per magnitude of spell in ingredients (for special inks/parchments, etc.).

The resulting scroll is a one-use item which, upon a successful Sorcery Casting test, casts the spell(s) with any included manipulations at the magnitude that was cast on the scroll.

Alternatively, upon a successful Sorcery Casting skill test, the reader of the scroll can learn the spell by spending the appropriate number of _Growth point_s.

Either way, upon the successful use of the scroll, the spell fades from the scroll. If the casting roll merely fails, the spell remains, but the reader cannot attempt to use the scroll until their Sorcery Casting skill increases. If the casting roll is fumbled, the spell fades from the scroll, without any benefit to the reader.

### Make Spell Matrix

Permanent

This spell creates items that store Sorcery spells.

All spell matrices have an attached cost of 10 Gold Ducats per spell in special materials.

The enchanter pays 1 Growth point per spell stored in the matrix.

The wielder can cast and manipulate the spell at the skill of the original enchanter, using their own magic points as fuel.

Spell matrices are reusable and permanent.

Spell matrices are mundane items in their own right and if the item is broken, the spell is dispelled. However, at the time of enchantment, the enchanter can spend another growth point to magically harden the item, making it indestructible.

### Mirage

This is the Sorcerers' version of Illusion.

This spell creates an illusion based on all five senses. The illusion will seem real and solid unless the person looking at it succeeds in a Perception test, which is subject to a modifier based on the magnitude of the spell. If the viewer succeeds in a Perception test, and the illusion could usually cause damage if believed in, it can no longer cause damage to that character. As soon as a viewer disbelieves the illusion, it becomes insubstantial and ghost-like to them.

The size of the illusion is also governed by the magnitude. A magnitude 1 Illusion can be used to create small household items, say a fake table and chair, but would not be able to create an illusion of a fire-breathing dragon.

| Magnitude | Modifier to Perception test | Type of illusion possible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | +50 % | Not capable of motion or causing damage. Slightly fuzzy and unreal around the edges. Limit of SIZ 10. |
| 2 | +25 % | Some minor discrepancies. Capable of motion, but not of damage. Limit of SIZ 15. |
| 3 | 0 | Capable of motion and causing damage. Limit of SIZ 20. |
| 4 | -25 % | Capable of motion and causing damage. Limit of SIZ 30. |
| 5 | -50 % | Indistinguishable from the real thing, capable of motion and damage. Limit of SIZ 40. |
| +1 | -50% | +10 SIZ per magnitude. |

### Mystic Vision

Concentration

This spell allows the recipient to literally see magic. By augmenting the recipient's natural vision, the spell allows them to see a creature's magic points, as well as enchanted items with their own magic points or spells. The recipient must be able to see the creature or object for this spell to work. Mystic Vision also allows a recipient to see into the Spirit World.

On a normal success, the recipient of the spell will only know roughly how many magic points an object or creature has (1–10, 11–20, 21–30 and so forth). On a critical, they will know the exact amount. On a fumble, the Referee should give the player a misleading total.

By looking at a spell's effect, a recipient of Mystic Vision will automatically be aware of its magical origin (Divine Magic, Personal Magic, or Sorcery). By increasing the magnitude of Mystic Vision, the caster can learn more about what they are seeing. Compare the magnitude of Mystic Vision to the magnitude of any spell that the target is either casting or under the influence of. As long as Mystic Vision's magnitude exceeds the other spell's, the caster will be able to precisely determine the effects of the perceived spell, and a mental image of who cast the spell (if it is not obvious).

By looking at an enchanted item, a recipient of Mystic Vision will automatically be aware of its gross magical effects (such as the types of enchantment currently on the item). Each point of magnitude of Mystic Vision will also determine either the invested POW (and therefore the relevant strength) of a particular enchantment or a particular condition laid upon an enchantment (Referee's choice).

### Neutralise Magic

Instant

This spell allows a caster to neutralise other spells. Neutralise Magic will eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its own magnitude, starting with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate the most powerful spell, then it will instead target the second-most powerful spell. As soon as Neutralise Magic can no longer dismiss a target's spells, because all the remaining spell's magnitudes are too high, its effects immediately end.

Neutralise Magic can be fired as a Reaction, but only when another spell that the character wishes to counter is cast within Neutralise Magic's range. A successful Neutralise Magic disrupts the other spell and nullifies it. As long as Neutralise Magic's magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell's magnitude, the target spell is countered.

### Other World Portal (Other World)

This spell creates a portal to a named Other World. The magnitude of the spell is the number of creatures (of SIZ range 12-18) who can use the portal simultaneously. The portal exists as long as the spell is in effect. When the spell's duration is reached, the portal closes instantly.

If the spell casting is fumbled, catastrophic events occur. Here are some example events. The creative Referee is encouraged to create more.

A malignant creature from that Other World emerges and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close the portal.

The sorcerer and all within 10m of them are sucked through the portal, which then promptly closes. Worse, the Sorcerer is so befuddled that they cannot remember this spell for D20+D4 hours.

The Other World, to which the portal is connected, invades the home reality in a 1D10 km diameter from the portal. The home reality protects itself by throwing up a magical barrier that lets things into the beachhead but not out.

### Palsy

Resist (Resilience)

If the caster is able to overcome their Target with this spell, they can turn the victim's own nervous system against them. The spell will paralyse the target, provided the spell's magnitude is greater than quarter of the target's current hit points.

### Poison Antidote

This spell counteracts an antidote to any poison. For the duration of the spell, it reduces any poison's potency by its magnitude X 5. This is for the chance to resist the poison initially. If that resistance test is failed, it still reduces the poison's effective potency by its magnitude X 5. If cast on a person who is already affected by a poison, they get another chance to resist the poison.

### Protective Sphere

When completed, the Protective Sphere will create a sphere-shaped area of protection with a radius in metres equal to the spell's magnitude. If this spell is cast on the ground (or another immovable place), it cannot be moved. If cast on a vehicle (such as the bed of a wagon) or a person, it will move with the target. After the sphere has been completed any one or all of the following spells can be added to provide the defensive capacities of the Sphere during the duration of the Sphere. The Sphere on its own provides no protection, that is down to the Resistance spells.

Damage Resistance, Spell Resistance, Spirit Resistance.

The Protective Sphere's perimeter contains the benefits of its combined Resistance spell(s). The Protective Sphere only inhibits spells or attacks entering the circle from the outside – attacks or spells originating within the circle are unaffected. Thus, a Protective Sphere against spirits would block out outside spirits but have no effect on those already inside its perimeter. A Protective Sphere against damage or spells would block out incoming attacks/spells but have no effect on attacks made within the sphere (including attacks targeting those outside the sphere).

### Remove Disease

This spell purges the recipient of any disease that is currently afflicting them. Make an opposed roll of the spell's magnitude vs. the disease's potency. If successful the character is restored to full health, any penalties to characteristics are removed and any hit points lost to the effects of the disease are regained.

### (Sense) Projection

Concentration

Each (Sense) Projection spell is a separate spell. These spells encompass the five base senses, but there are also variants for any unusual sensory mechanisms appropriate to the game world (such as sonar).

This spell allows the caster to project one of their senses anywhere within the spell's range. The spell forms an invisible and intangible sensor, some ten centimetres across, which receives the specified type of sensory input and transmits it to the caster. The sensor can move metres per combat round equal to the spell's magnitude, directed by the sorcerer, and allows the sorcerer to use their Perception skill through the sensor.

Spells can be cast through the sensor of some Projection spells. For instance, ranged spells require Sight Projection, while touch spells require Touch Projection (and likely Sight Projection too, so the Sorcerer can find their target efficiently).

Characters using Mystic Vision can see the sensor and attack it if they wish, though it is only vulnerable to magic. Magical weapons and spells employed against the sensor will not destroy it but will instead transfer their damage directly to the caster.

### Sense (Substance)

Concentration

Eminently useful for finding valuables from afar, this spell has a variation for every substance imaginable. Sense (Substance) will cause all sources of the substance within range of the spell to glow an appropriate colour, visible only to the caster – diamonds will gleam like ice, amber will shine like a camp-fire and so on. Each point of this spell's magnitude allows it to penetrate one metre of rock, wood or dirt. If the source is concealed behind such a material, the surface nearest the caster will glow for a moment. The spell cannot penetrate refined metal, though it can penetrate ore.

### Shapechange (Species) to (Species)

Resist (Resilience), Touch

Each Shapechange spell is a separate spell. Of all the spells with multiple variations, the Shapechange spell has the most, comprising a new spell for almost every combination of creatures imaginable. The spell only works on living things – the dead or inanimate cannot be shape changed.

The magnitude of the spell must be equal to or greater than the average SIZ of both specified species. Thus, changing a mouse (SIZ 1) into a newt (also SIZ 1) is magnitude 1. Changing a mouse into a lion (SIZ 19) is magnitude 10.

If the spell is successful, the target will be biologically changed, gaining the STR, DEX, CON and SIZ of its new form. Its INT, POW and CHA are unchanged, and the target retains its memories and abilities (though it may be unable to use some of those abilities in its new form).

### Skin of Life

Touch

This spell protects the recipient from suffocation by air deprivation, due to such factors as drowning or the Smother spell. Each point of magnitude will cover three points of SIZ – thus a magnitude 4 Skin of Life spell would sustain a SIZ 12 creature.

### Smother

Concentration, Resist (Resilience Special)

If successful, this spell neutralises the air surrounding the target, making each breath stale and worthless, depriving it of oxygen. The caster must concentrate each round, in order to keep the spell operating. For the duration of the spell, the target will be unable to breathe, essentially drowning on dry land.

When the spell begins, the target's Resilience test determines whether it is able to gasp in one last breath before Smother cuts off the surrounding oxygen supply. If the target succeeds, it may hold its breath as normal. If it fails, it will start drowning in the next combat round.

This spell can also be used to extinguish fires, as the flames will be starved of oxygen. At magnitude 1, it can extinguish a Flame, magnitude 2 a Large Flame, magnitude 4 a Small Fire, magnitude 7 a Large Fire and magnitude 10 it will put out an Inferno. Smother has no effect on magical fire or on fire-based creatures.

### Spell Resistance

This spell matches its magnitude against the magnitude of any incoming spell. If Spell Resistance's magnitude is greater than the incoming spell's, then the incoming spell has no effect. If the incoming spell's magnitude is equal to or greater than the magnitude of Spell Resistance, then the spell affects the target normally.

Unlike many protective spells, Spell Resistance remains in place for the entirety of its duration – spells that successfully breach the spell do not dispel it. However, it does not discriminate between incoming spells – a comrade attempting to magically heal the recipient of Spell Resistance must overcome it in order to successfully use a healing spell.

### Spirit Resistance

This spell matches its magnitude against the POW of any spirit that comes into contact with the recipient. If the recipient of the caster's POW the Spirit Resistance's magnitude is greater than the spirit's POW, the spirit cannot touch the recipient.

A spirit unable to touch a recipient will not be able to attack or directly harm them, including through ranged attacks. A spell cast by a spirit at the recipient is blocked unless its magnitude exceeds the Spirit Resistance's magnitude.

### Summon (Other World creature)

Resist (Persistence)

This spell allows the sorcerer to summon one Other World creature, per casting, to the mundane world. The creature is not automatically under the sorcerer's control. If the summoned creature succeeds its Persistence test, it is free of the sorcerer's command and, if so inclined, may be hostile to the sorcerer. Otherwise, it acts as if under the influence of a Dominate spell, for the duration of the spell. The duration of the summon spell also determines how long the creature is trapped in the Mundane World.

Example Other World creatures: Demons, Elementals, Spirits and Undead.

### Tap (characteristic)

Concentration, Resist (Persistence), Touch

There are actually seven Tap spells, one for each characteristic. These devastating spells allow the caster to permanently strip a target of characteristic points, transforming them into magic points for their own use.

The caster must make contact with the target, either physically or through Touch Projection, in order to Tap it – therefore the spell cannot be used on incorporeal creatures, such as spirits.

Tap will only work if its magnitude is equal to, or greater than, the target's specified characteristic. Thus, a magnitude 6 Tap Strength spell would only work on targets with a STR of 6 or lower.

The number of points Tapped by the spell is equal to 1D6 per combat round the spell is applied to the victim.

Characteristic points lost to Tap are lost permanently, though the victim can raise them again through the normal means of increasing a characteristic. Characteristics may be tapped to 0, which usually involves the death of the victim (the exception being Charisma).

For each characteristic point the sorcerer Taps, they will gain one magic point. The sorcerer is limited in the number of magic points they can gain through Tap; the spell can only increase their magic points to double their normal limit. A sorcerer may simply Tap a target and dissipate any gained magic points.

If the sorcerer gains more magic points through Tap than their normal maximum, the points will disappear at the rate of one magic point per minute once the spell finishes.

### Teleport

Instant, Resist (Dodge)

Teleport allows a sorcerer to move their self or a target, instantaneously, to anywhere within the range of the spell, as long as the destination can be directly observed (Sense Projection spells allow the Caster to 'see' locations beyond the physical line of sight), there is solid footing, and no objects bar their arrival. If these conditions are not met, the spell automatically fails. The caster is able to teleport objects up to 3 points of SIZ per point of magnitude.

### Time Travel (Time Period)

Instant

This spell transports the caster and creatures (of SIZ 12-18) equal to the magnitude of the spell to a named time era via a time tunnel that opens up and instantly sucks them through to their destination. The duration of the spell is the time that the caster and group jump forward or backwards through time.

Sorcerers usually have some knowledge about the time period they are travelling to and use an Anchor, a landmark such as a bronze statue, that exists in both the original and destination time period. If they are travelling blind without such an Anchor, the casting roll is at -25%, and the effects of a fumbled roll are even more catastrophic than the examples below suggest.

If the spell casting is failed, the caster and group still travel, but they end up in the wrong location (1D10 Km away from the anchor point) and time (1D10 time units away, the length of the time unit depends on duration, e.g. if the duration was in days, the time unit is days).

If the spell casting is fumbled, catastrophic events occur. Here are some example events, the creative Referee is encouraged to create more:

A guardian creature from the Other World emerges through the portal and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close the portal.

The sorcerer, and all within 10m of them, is sucked through the portal which then promptly closes. The sorcerer is so befuddled that they cannot remember the spell for D20+D4 hours.

As above, but the sorcerer and party arrive in a completely different Time Era or even an Alternative Reality.

Sorcerers with this spell can "change" time freely without having to worry about unintentional "butterfly effect" changes or any alterations in their own existence or memory from changing "their" past. However, regular use risks the catastrophic effects of a fumble.

### Treat Wounds

Instant, Touch

This spell must be cast upon a wounded character. It dramatically accelerates the natural healing rate of the target. For every point of magnitude of this spell the caster can repair one hit point per combat round, for the duration of the spell.

The spell cast at magnitude 6 instantly heals mortal wounds, bringing the character's hit point total to one.

This spell does not treat disease or poison. See Remove Disease and Poison Antidote, respectively.

### Venom

Resist (Resilience Special), Touch

This spell infuses the target's body with a magical poison. The potency of the poison is equal to the spell's magnitude x 5, takes effect instantly, and does damage equal to the magnitude per combat round for the spell's duration. The target may resist the poison with a Resilience test.

# OQ3 SRD Creatures

## The Creature List

Each of the following creatures is described in the following format.

### Characteristics

These are the characteristics that the creature possesses. If a creature is missing a characteristic for any reason, the effect of this is noted under the Special rules section for that creature. Two scores are given for each characteristic. Firstly, the dice range which you can roll to determine an individual's characteristics randomly, and in brackets the score of an average individual of that species. This average score is used throughout the rest of the stats, so you can quickly pick up and use the creatures. If you randomly roll characteristics, you will have to adjust the rest of the skills and other characteristic dependent scores accordingly.

A creature with a randomly determined INT is considered sentient – it is a rational creation capable of logical thought and self-determination. A creature with a fixed INT (any INT listed as a single number, rather than a die roll) is not sentient. Fixed INT creatures operate solely on instinct rather than logic or intuition.

### Attributes

The grouping gives the hit points, damage modifier and magic points of the creature. Again, these are based upon the characteristic scores of an average member of the species. Also listed is the creature's movement rate (MR), with a note if the creature can fly or swim. The profile also gives typical armour worn, including the Armour Points (AP), as well as the creature's Loot Factor.

### Skills

Creatures have skills like player characters. This section breaks down into the skills categories and details the significant skills that an average member or this species will have. Combat skills have the damage listed, including damage modifier, and other details for the weapon used, in brackets next to the weapons name. Unless otherwise noted, a creature with multiple attack forms will only get to use one as its combat action.

### Magic

This section gives suggestions of the type of magic spells that an average member of the species will know.

### Special Rules

This section has details of other rules that apply to the creature. Its abilities are described where necessary.

## Creature Descriptions

### Basilisk

| 4 | 13 | 7 | 2 | 3 | 16 | 3 |

***Attributes***

| Hit Points | Damage Modifier | Magic Points | MR | Armour | Loot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | -1D6 | 16 | 15m | Scales (2pt) | 5 |

***Skills***

Resistances: Dodge 30%, Persistence 50%, Resilience 70%.

Practical: Athletics 60%, Deception 40%.

Knowledge: Natural lore 40%.

***Combat***

Ranged Combat 100%: Gaze (Death, 1 CR, Range: POW in metres).

Unarmed Combat 30%: Bite (1D6–1D6+poison).

Note: The basilisk can attack with both gaze and bite simultaneously in the same action.

***Magic***

Basilisks do not learn magic.

***Special Rules***

_Corrosive Blood_: Any non-magical weapon hitting the basilisk corrodes in the creature's blood, completely disintegrating after 1D4 rounds.

The basilisk's poison and corrosive blood are magical effects, which lose their special properties a few minutes after leaving the basilisk's body, making it virtually impossible to use the creature as a source for making lethal compounds.

_Basilisk Venom_

Type: Ingested or smeared.

Delay: Immediate.

Potency: 65.

Full Effect: 1D4 Hit Point damage, applies –6 penalty to victim's CON.

Duration: 6D10 minutes.

_Death Gaze_: A basilisk can kill with a glance. In combat, the basilisk glares at a single opponent each round. If the basilisk overcomes the target in an opposed test of its Persistence against the target's Resilience, the target dies instantly. Using the gaze attack costs no magic points, and the basilisk may normally attack in any round in which it uses the gaze attack. This attack penetrates magical defences as if it were a Magnitude 6 Personal Magic spell. If the target successfully resists the gaze attack, they are unharmed, though they may be targeted again.

### Bloodweed

Fast-moving and agile, they either charge up to their victims or creep up using plant overgrowth as cover (+25 to Deception if plant cover is available).

***Characteristics***

***Skills***

Resistances: Dodge 90%, Persistence 80%, Resilience 90%.

Practical: Athletics 90%, Deception 90%, Perception 35%.

***Combat***

Unarmed Combat 90%: Grapple, then inflict pain (Choke attack), Bloodsucking bite (1D4 +1D4+ 1D6 Magic Point drain).

***Special Rules***

Bloodsucking bite, the bloodweed's bite causes blood loss which also drains 1D6 Magic Points.

Any creature caught in the flame suffers 4D6 fire damage, though on a successful Dodge roll a character may dive for cover to halve this damage and AP counts as normal.

### Elemental

The only characteristic that an elemental has is SIZ; all of its derived attributes and skills are based on this.

***Elemental Scores***

| Size of Elemental | SIZ | Damage | Hit Points (=SIZ) | Attack (=SIZ x 5) | Area of attack (=SIZ /3) | MR | Dodge | Persistence | Resilience\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 3 | 1D6 | 3 | 25% | 1m | 15m | 100 | 30 | 100 |
| Medium | 9 | 2D6 | 9 | 45% | 3m | 20m | 90 | 60 | 100 |
| Large | 21 | 3D6 | 21 | 80% | 7m | 30m | 60 | 80 | 100 |
| Huge | 50 | 4D6 | 50 | 100% | 16m | 45m | 30 | 100 | 100 |

Elementals attack by engulfing their enemies. All opponents within the area of attack are potential targets. Elementals use their Attack percentage, which is equal to their size times five, to hit the target, who then resists using the resistance appropriate to the attack.

\*Elementals are immune to disease and poison.

| Elemental | Type of attack | Resistance used | Attribute damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Undines | Drown | Resilience | Hit Points |
| Shade | Fear | Persistence | Magic Points |
| Salamander | Burning | Resilience | Hit Points |
| Gnome | Crush | Resilience | Hit Points |
| Sylph | Bluster | Resilience | Hit Points |

Shades attack using Fear. When they reduce their opponent's Magic Point's total to zero, they literally die of shock.

***Other Elemental Abilities***

**See invisible:** Elementals have magical senses that allow them to 'see' invisible creatures, such as immaterial spirits. They also gain a +50% when detecting hidden characters.

**Almost invisible against the same element:** All elementals have the equivalent of a 90% Deception when lying next to an environment of the same element as themselves. For example, undines are nearly invisible when lying in a pool of water and gnomes can curl up and blend into a surrounding rocky area.

***Combat***

Close Combat 80%: War Maul (2D8+1D6).

Unarmed Combat 60%: Fist (1D6+1D6).

***Magic***

Since mummies are POW-less, they never have Personal Magic. Mummies who were priests in their previous lives may have Divine Magic, and mummies who know sorcery will always know at least one Tap spell to gain Magic Points to fuel their spells.

_Undead Sorcerer_. Sorcery Casting 75%: Tap POW, Mirage, Neutralise Magic, Venom.

***Special Rules***

An Ignite spell will work on a mummy's body. A strike with a fiery weapon, such as a sword with a Fireblade spell on it, or even a torch, will ignite the mummy if the hit causes damage. The damage done by the initial hit is taken each combat round as fire damage unless the fire is put out. To put out a fire, the mummy must take one combat round to roll on the ground or immerse itself in water. During this time, it may not make any other actions or reactions.

Healing spells are ineffective on mummies, though a Repair spell will fix any damage done (in 1D10 hit point increments).

When a creature becomes a mummy, its STR and CON are doubled. The statistics above represent a human mummy, though any sentient creature willing to undergo the process may become a mummy.

### Nymphs

Killing a nymph's physical body sends it back to the magic world to regenerate. The nymph, if unmolested in the magic world, will form a new body in her special place after 2D6 days, provided the place remains intact.

#### Dryad

A dryad is a nymph of a particular area of woodland, a grove of a radius in metres equal to twice her POW. The dryad cannot leave this territory. If she does, her physical body disintegrates into leaves and flowers, to reform in the magic world as above. Within a dryad's grove is a particular tree that they are mystically linked to; they will endure for as long as their personal tree endures, and no longer.

A dryad can form or dissolve her body by stepping out of or into this tree, though if a dryad's body is destroyed, it takes her time (as for any nymph) to form another.

***Characteristics***

***Special Rules***

A dryad controls all of the plants within her grove. She can cause them to move slowly, grow surprisingly rapidly, or blossom or bear fruit out of season. This power cannot be used as a direct attack.

#### Hag

Hags embody darkness and shadows. Hags are associated with caves and other dark areas seldom exposed to direct sunlight. A hag can only leave her domain when it is night and must return there before dawn; if she does not, her physical body is destroyed.

A hag's body is also destroyed if she is struck by direct sunlight. A hag may form and dissolve her body at will, although if her body is destroyed, it takes a hag time (as for any nymph) to form another.

A hag can create a shade out of the darkness of her lair. Doing this costs one magic point per point of SIZ the shade has. A hag can only manifest one shade at a time, though if it is destroyed she can create another.

#### Naiad

Naiads are nymphs of the water, whether a particular stream, stretch of river, lake, swamp or, occasionally, a part of the coastline.

For every ten metres a naiad moves from her body of water, she loses a magic point. If she reaches zero magic points, her body collapses into a pool of water and her spirit returns to her domain. A naiad can only regain magic points when completely submerged in water.

#### Oread

An oread is a nymph associated with a particular hill, mountain, or valley. For every ten metres an oread moves from her domain, she loses a magic point. If she reaches zero magic points, her body turns to stone and her spirit returns home.

_Scream_. Anyone in an area of fifty meters who can hear the Pentaghast's scream is subject to nausea and vomiting for 1D4 rounds on a failed Resilience roll. Once the targets have either successfully or unsuccessfully resisted the scream, they are no longer affected by it. Mocking laughter. Anyone who can hear the pentaghast's terrible laughter is subject to a Demoralize spell. The demon can laugh once every two combat rounds.

_Create Puppet._ Once per day a pentaghast is able to create a humanoid puppet out of dung. The puppet is guided by the pentaghast's will. Use a standard species template (e.g. human, dwarf, elf, orc, etc..) to provide stats and base skills for the puppet, but use the knowledge skills of the demon. Such puppets tend to be heavily scented with perfume, to hide the smell of the dung, so are only detected on a successful Perception test.

_The Gift of Tongues._ The Pentaghast is able to speak all languages and mimic flawlessly the speech of any person it has previously heard.

_Damage Immunity._ The Pentaghast is only damaged by magic and is immune to non-magical poisons and disease.

***Skills***

\*Immune to all mind control magic, poison and disease.

Practical: Athletics 30%, Perception 75%, Deception 75%.

***Combat***

Unarmed Combat 75%: Envelop (Acid damage equal to the Slime's SIZ).

***Magic***

Slimes do not learn magic.

***Special Rules***

A slime can only be killed by fire or magic. Normal weapons merely pass through the slime's rancid tissue, without causing damage. Because of a slime's caustic nature, neither acid nor poison has any effect on it. Non-fiery Weapon Enhance spells do no damage to a slime. Disruption and similar spells have their normal effect.

A slime's body retains its full acidic properties for a number of days after death equal to the creature's CON.

It attacks by moving next to its intended victim and attempting to envelop them. This attack has a base 75% chance of success, though the victim may use his Dodge skill or his Athletics skill to jump out of the way. Using Athletics rather than Dodge incurs a –40% penalty. A slime's attack may not be parried – the creature will simply slide around the parrying weapon to engulf its foe.

Every round a creature is enmeshed by a slime, that creature will take acid damage equal to the SIZ of the Slime. Armour will protect against this damage for the first round, after which it is dissolved by the Slime's acid unless it is enchanted in some way or another. A character caught by a slime may attempt to escape by making another Dodge or Athletics skill test.

The slime can also crawl up walls and hang from ceilings.

### Spirits

Spirits can engage in Spirit Combat with living creatures that have a POW characteristic. If they win the combat, they possess the loser, since spirits crave a physical body for a variety of reasons, depending on their type. For example, disease spirits possess their victims and riddle their bodies with foul disease. See Spirit Possession in Combat chapter for more information.

Spirits lack a physical presence, due to lack of STR, CON and DEX.

#### Disease Spirit

Knowledge: Lore (Disease) 100%, Lore (Spirit World) 40%.

Practical: Deception 30%.

Spirit Combat 50%: Spectral Claw (1D6).

***Special Rules***

A disease spirit is, in essence, a disease, either mundane or magical. After covertly possessing its victim, the possessed one will be forced to make Resilience tests to resist the effects of the disease. The disease cannot be thrown off until the disease spirit is ousted. Also, the spirit will nearly always choose to apply its POW as a penalty to the possessed one's Resilience tests.

If the possessed one dies while being possessed by a disease spirit, there is a percentage chance equal to the spirit's POW that they will arise as a new disease spirit in 2D6 hours.

#### Ghost

Those that should have passed into the afterlife, but who have not found peace, remain to haunt the living as ghosts. Jealous and mean, they seek to do harm to the living and often will try to possess a victim to experience the joys of living once again.

Personal Magic Casting 65%: Befuddle, Demoralise, Scare 4

***Special Rules***

Ghosts can only be affected by magic spells which either dominate or drive them off, or by characters who can engage in Spirit Combat.

#### Healing Spirit

The nemesis of the disease spirit, this spirit appears as a happy bright glowing orb. They are typically summoned to help heal the sick and wounded.

***Skills***

Resistances: Dodge 40%, Persistence 50%.

Knowledge: Lore (Disease) 100%, Lore (Spirit World) 60%.

Spirit Combat 50%: Spiritual Blast 1D6.

***Special Rules***

The natural enemy of disease spirits, a healing spirit is only capable of entering Spirit Combat with a disease spirit already covertly possessing a creature. If the healing spirit can bring the disease spirit to zero Hit Points, it will force it to leave its host. The healing spirit will then depart as well, for it cannot permanently possess any creature.

If a healing spirit is used on an individual who is sick from a mundane illness (rather than from a disease spirit), it will add its POW as a percentage bonus to the individual's chance of success on their next Resilience test to throw off the effects of the disease.

#### Magic Spirit

Magic spirits are spirits that have mastery of one or more spells. If bound, the holder of the spirit may use the spirit's Magic Points for casting spells.

Magic spirits may not initiate spirit combat but may use the spells it knows to attack or defend itself.

They appear as a series of multi-coloured orbs, equal in number to the number of spells they know.

***Characteristics***

| STR | CON | DEX | SIZ | INT | POW | CHA |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N/A | N/A | 14 | 30m | None | 0 |

***Magic***

A magic spirit knows 1D6 Personal Magic, Divine Magic or Sorcery spells. These spirits will only know one spell type. For example, a magic spirit will not have both Divine and Sorcery spells, nor may it ever learn spells of another type. If the spirit casts Divine Magic, it must regain the use of spent spells in the same way a priest does. If casting Sorcery or Personal Magic, it has a casting skill equal to its POW x 5.

***Skills***

Resistances: Dodge 40%, Persistence 50%.

Knowledge: Lore (Spirit World) 60%.

Spirit Combat 50%: Spiritual Blast (1D6).

#### Passion Spirits (Fear, Madness, Pain)

##### **Fear Spirit**

If a fear spirit covertly possesses a host, the host becomes permanently Demoralised (as the spell), until the spirit is cast out.

##### **Madness Spirit**

If a madness spirit succeeds in covertly possessing a victim, it will manifest itself in daily bouts of insanity. At least once per day, the madness spirit will attempt to cause an insane fit in its host. It matches its Persistence against the host's Resilience in a standard opposed test. If the host succeeds, the madness spirit will be quiescent for at least a number of hours equal to the host's POW.

If the host fails, he becomes incapacitated for 1D20 hours – screaming madly, giggling incoherently or simply becoming catatonic for the duration of the effect. The madness spirit chooses the manner of madness, though most are partial to a single effect. The madness spirit will also attempt to assert itself whenever its host is in a stressful situation. Combat is an obvious example, but these spirits also delight in affecting their hosts in a variety of other stressful, important situations – collapsing into a fit of mad giggling while petitioning an unfriendly king for a boon is exactly the kind of thing madness spirits enjoy. Note, if the stressful situation occurs during a period of forced quiescence on the part of the spirit, it will be unable to manifest itself.

##### **Pain Spirit**

If a pain spirit manages to possess its target covertly, the victim will be overcome with a sudden burst of pain. From that point on, until the spirit is cast out, the victim will always be conscious of a dull ache in his joints or a twinge in his muscles. Whenever the host acts quickly (as in combat) or concentrates (as in spell casting), and sometimes purely at random intervals, he is struck by a sudden spasm of pain. This pain reduces all the host's skill tests by a penalty equal to the spirit's POW.

For example, if a pain spirit with a POW of 17 possesses a victim, that victim loses 17% from all skill tests so long as the spirit possesses him. If they had an Athletics skill of 90%, were attempting to climb a cliff and rolled an 80, the test would be a failure as the pain spirit effectively reduces their skill to 73%.

***Combat***

Close Combat 50%: Longsword (1D8+1D6), Target Shield (1D6+1D6).

Unarmed Combat 60%: Bite (1D6 + Magic Point drain, see below).

***Magic***

Some Vampires are highly magical and will either be a priest of an appropriate death religion or make use of sorcery. Priests will have at least 10 points of magnitude of spells and Sorcerers will know at least five spells

_Vampire Lord Priest_

Personal Magic Casting 75%: Darkwall, Tongues.

Divine Magic: Fear, Touch of Death.

_Vampire Lord Sorcerer_

Sorcery Casting 75%: Dominate Humans, Energy Projection (Cold), Mystic Vision, Neutralise Magic, Venom.

***Special rules***

_Night vision._ Vampires can see in the dark and at night as if it were day by sensing life energy.

_Magic Point Drain._ A vampire does not regenerate Hit Points or Magic Points normally. Instead, they must take them from other beings by draining their blood. On a successful bite attack, the vampire will hang on and drain D6 Magic Points from the victim every round. Each drained Magic Point gives the vampire one Hit Point or Magic Point (vampire's choice). When the Vampire drains the victim's Magic Points to 0, the victim falls unconscious, as normal, and the vampire can choose to carry on draining blood, except now it's the victim's permanent POW that is drained.

_Shapeshifting._ Vampires have the ability to shapeshift into mist at will. As a single Combat Action, the vampire (and every non-living item on his person) dissolves into a thin greenish fog, approximately the same SIZ as they were in the flesh. As a mist, the vampire is immune to all types of physical damage, but cannot take any action except moving up to their MR. In mist form, a vampire moves at the same speed as they would normally and is unaffected by strong winds. Additionally, vampires still take damage from sunlight in mist form.

As well as the ability to transform into mist, some vampires manifest the ability to shapeshift into wolves and bats as well. As with the mist transformation, such changes take a Combat Action to perform.

Upon death, the vampire collapses to the ground and turns to mist at the beginning of the next Combat Round. Before then, it can be destroyed permanently by driving a stake through its heart (the only way to prevent it from turning to mist) and decapitating it.

_Vampires and Sunlight._ As creatures of the night, vampires cannot stand the touch of natural sunlight. They take one point of damage to every hit location per round that they are exposed to the sun, though some will risk travelling in the daylight hours by wearing layers of clothing and a hood to cover as much of their body as possible.

_Holy symbols._ In the past, the holy icons of some religion have proved effective against vampires. Those that focus their energies against the undead are the most likely to be effective. It is down to the Referee to decide what supernaturally offends any particular vampire. An elven vampire, for example, might be repelled by symbols of nature gods, rather than by human symbols of holiness. Any character presenting a holy symbol to a vampire as a Combat Action matches their Persistence against the vampire's Resilience in an opposed check. They will receive bonuses or penalties at the Referee's discretion, based on the appropriateness of the symbol being displayed. On a successful test, the vampire loses 1D4 Hit Points (unaffected by armour or any of the vampire's magic) and may not attack that character or any other character under the protection of Holy Symbol.

| 11 (22 as wolf) | 11 | 11 | 13 | 13 (6 as wolf) | 11 | 11 |

***Attributes***

| 12 | +1D6 in wolf form | 11 | 15m as man, 30m in wolf form | Hide (1 AP) | 0 |

***Skills***

Resistances: Dodge 60%, Persistence 60%, Resilience 60%.

Knowledge: Natural Lore 80%.

Practical: Athletics 60%, Deception 60%, Perception 60%.

***Combat***

Close Combat 35% (as human): Longsword (1D8).

Ranged Combat 25% (as human): Short Bow (1D8, 1 CR, 75m).

Unarmed Combat 60% (as wolf): Bite (1D8+1D4), Claw (1D6+1D4).

***Magic***

Werewolves either learn Personal Magic handed down from their ancestors to their family, a grouping known as the pack, or join an Earth religion of a particularly rough and savage nature.

_Initiate of the Wolf Lord_

Personal Magic: Beast Call [2], Fanaticism [2], Coordination 3, Healing 3.

Divine Magic: Berserk.

***Special Rules***

_Night Vision._ Werewolves have night vision, and at night they can see as well as they can during the day.

_Shape-Shifting._ Werewolves can change form at will, an act that requires a Combat Round to complete. On nights of a full moon, werewolves have no choice but to assume beast form.

While in wolf form, werewolves are immune to most damage. Only magic, fire or weapons made of pure silver will harm them – all other blows simply bounce off harmlessly. If a normal sword with a Weapon Enhance 3 spell cast on it is used against a werewolf, only the three points of damage from the spell will affect the creature; the weapon's normal damage, as well as the attacker's Damage Modifier, do not count. The werewolf's thick skin, which grants the beast one point of armour, would reduce the Weapon Enhance spell's damage to two. If the entire weapon is enchanted, such as with a Fireblade spell, the entire damage rolled will count, though the wielder's Damage Modifier will still be ignored.

Werewolves can be poisoned, so long as the poison can be introduced to the creature's body. They are living entities who require oxygen and thus may be asphyxiated or drowned.

### Wyvern

These giant slender green reptiles are akin to dragons but with no forelegs and animal intelligence.

## The Animal List

This list describes more mundane animals. It lists domestic animals (such as horses and cattle), as well as wild beasts. Some of the animals are in their 'Giant' form, which are more threatening opponents than their normal sized versions.

None of the animals listed here have any treasure by design. They may have some as determined by the Referee as fits the needs of the story. For example, a carnivore may have a few trinkets in the remains of its previous meals.

All the animals listed here have fixed INT and therefore not sentient. None of them knows any magic.

# OQ 3 SRD Loot

## Loot Factor

Normally, the needs of the story can dictate what treasure and magical items a creature possesses, but if a quick random roll is necessary, do the following.

Each creature has a 'Loot Factor', which is a rating of how much treasure the creature is likely to be carrying. For creatures that form groups, increase the Loot Factor by at least one, for groups of up to 20 creatures; by two for larger groups of up to a hundred creatures; and by 3 for groups of over a hundred. In this last case, the Loot will likely be held in a defended and guarded treasure room.

***Loot table***

| Loot factor | Treasure found |
| --- | --- |
| 0. | Not a hoarder. No treasure whatsoever. |
| 1. | Chance hoarder. A couple of coppers, loose change (1D6 CP). Very remote (5%) chance of a minor magical item, which is either used by accident (my lucky talisman) or which the creature is completely oblivious to. |
| 2. | Hoards enough for a rainy day. About 5D20 SP, 1D10 GD. If the creature uses magic, there is a POW % chance of 1D4 minor magic items appropriate to the type. |
| 3. | Hoards for a better future. Collects treasure for its worth and appreciates its value. 5D100 SP, 3D20 GD. If the creature uses magic, there is a POW X 2% chance of 1D4 appropriate minor magic items. |
| 4. | Significant hoard. Hoards for hoarding's sake. 10D100 SP, 1D100 GD. POW X 3% of 1D6 minor magic items and POW % chance of 1D4 major magic items, regardless of whether the creature uses magic. |
| 5. | Treasure trove. The wealth of a minor lord. Examples: Grave goods of a dead noble worth about 1D6 thousand SP, with 1D6 minor magic items and POW X 3% chance of 1D6 major magic items. |
| 6. | The wealth of kings or a dragon's hoard, with a size almost beyond comprehension. 1D4 Million SP, 2D10 minor magical items, 1D8 major magic items and one Relic or Artifact. |

Magic items will usually involve magic of the type used by the creature. In cases where the creature does not use magic but has the item in its hoard due to its value and beauty, roll on the following table.

**Magic type**

| Roll 1D6 | Type of magic in item |
| --- | --- |
| 1-4 | Personal Magic |
| 5 | Divine Magic |
| 6 | Sorcery |

_Minor magic items:_ 1 spell of 1D4+1 magnitude.

_Major magic items:_ 1D3+1 Spells of 1D6+2 magnitude.

_Artefacts/Relics:_ Artefacts and Relics are the stuff of legend, mighty magic items created by the gods (Relic) or the greatest magicians of the Age (Artifact). They are always one-of-a-kind and have powers beyond normal magic spells.

## Where do Magic Items Come From?

Most magic items in OpenQuest come from the player characters themselves. As they increase in competence through play, they can learn the various spells that allow them to create magic items (see the list below) and, in quiet moments between adventures, create new items. Non-player characters behave similarly, and so often provide further sources of items for the marauding player characters.

Other items that are placed by the Referee in the setting are quite rare in comparison. These are often quite powerful and have a background and history that is unique and important to the setting. These items are the Excalibur, Spear of Destiny and Holy Grail of your setting.

## Creating Magic Items

The characters or non-player character magicians will have created most magic items found in play in a game of OpenQuest.

Although the spells that the characters use to create magic items are detailed in their respective spell lists, it is worth going through them again briefly to remind yourself what spell does.

### Personal Magic

_Call Spirit._ Using this spell, it is possible to bind a spirit into an item. This is the spell that you use to bind your dead Uncle Argebor into his skull, so he can continue dishing out wise advice to his descendants long after his death.

_Create Charms._ The basic spell for creating Personal Magic items, use this spell to create rune-inscribed swords, paper talismans that protect against spirits, and dragon skin armour that is resistant to fire (via a Resist Fire spell).

_Create Magic Point Store._ If you want to create a magic item that has magic points ready stored, so the user doesn't have to use up their own, this is the spell to use.

Note: Remember, characters must spend growth points to use any of the above spells to create permanent and reusable magic items.

_Create Potions._ This is a quick way of making non-reusable spell stores where you've already spent the magic points, for you or your allies to gulp down for instant effect during combat. Think Healing + Create Potions, and you have the classic healing potion.

### Sorcery

Sorcerers quite frequently use their Sorcerer's Stone in addition to the spells outlined here, to create the reservoir of magic points needed to fuel manipulated Sorcery spells.

_Make Potion._ Either as a one spell container, or a blend of compatible spells.

_Make Scroll._ This spell is a quick way for sorcerers to transmit knowledge to each other and to create quick one-shot spells for their followers that, once cast, fire off at the full power that the sorcerer put in beforehand.

_Make Spell Matrix._ This is the basic method of inserting a Sorcery spell in an item.

### Divine Magic

Divine Magic users are usually less interested in creating magic items and more interested in spreading the word of their deity. However, there are exceptions.

_Create Blessed Item._ This spell is the only way Divine Magic users can create magic items. It is used to create a magical item for the use of a particularly important champion of the faith, or a king, who can carry the item as a living example of the power of the deity.

Other types of Divine Magic items, such as Relics and the arms and armour of the Holy Warrior, come directly from the deity themselves. Arms and Armour of a Holy Warrior can survive the death of their original owner, especially if they were powerful, but tend to be passed on within the religion or buried with the owner. Their effects do not work for someone who is not a member of the religion.

#### Relics

These are the bones, hair, preserved clothes, or some other very personal item, that belonged to a Holy Person associated with a religion (minimum rank Initiate).

- Each 'part' (an item of clothing, body part, etc.) stores one of the spells that the Holy Person knew in life at the magnitude they knew it.
- Relics come into being at the time of death of the Holy Person.
- The wielder of the relic can cast the spell which is reusable after being reconsecrated (see above).
- The wielder must be a member of the same religion that the Holy Person was a member of and must be in good standing with the deity.
- A Relic is unbreakable by normal non-magical means since the religion's divine power protects them.

## Finding out what a Magic Item Does

There is no catch-all "Detect Magical Properties" spell or "Know Magic Item" skill in OpenQuest. This is quite deliberate, keeping with the general policy that such items are not the equivalent of magical shotguns. Some options are:

_Consult a Sage or other magical expert._ This option will cost the characters lots of money. Take a baseline of one hundred silvers per point of spell magnitude OR some perilous quest that the character must do in return. Such experts are rare, because most high ranking magicians have little time for magical research for others, and would be more interested in their schemes. This really should be the last option, since it is the least mega gaming fun. In my campaign, I do not allow this.

_Detect Magic spells._ This merely tells you the item is magical. A critical casting may tell the caster how powerful the item is.

_Trial and error._ The character tries to find out the item's use by experiment. Allow creative and imaginative plans to reveal partially what the item does.

_Researching the myths and legends around the item._ This is the most certain way of finding out what a magic item does. Of course, such myths may be obscure themselves, requiring a dangerous Quest to a long-hidden repository of knowledge to find.

## Ad Hoc Magical Powers

Not all magic items have to have powers that directly mimic spells from the spell lists. Having magic items do this is an in-game contrivance and reflects the fact that most magic items are created by magicians who effectively store their magic spells in the items.

## Loot Items Format

Loot item write-ups have the following format. This is to give a concise description of the item and some background information which prevents the item from being bland and colourless.

_Background:_ Details of who and why it was created and significant owners and events in its history.

_Description:_ This is a physical description of the item.

_Creation:_ How the item was created. Usually, this section details the spells that were used and any special rituals that the creators used.

_Magic Powers:_ This section lists the relevant spells stored in the item. It is also noted here if any spirits are bound into the item, or if the item acts as a magic point store.

Finally, any special magic powers unique to the item are recorded here.

_Affiliations:_ This section lists the organisations which are friendly to the item, which will try especially hard to obtain the item. This ranges from paying extra silver to get hold of it to (if so inclined), resorting to violence or underhand methods. Enemies who, for old reasons, hate the item and will either go out of their way to avoid the user or to try to destroy the item.

_Price:_ If listed, this is the price that a collector would pay for the item. As a rough guide, the price of an item is 100 SP per magnitude of spell stored in it. However, very rarely will a magic item be available on the open market and in most fantasy worlds there is no such thing as 'Ye Olde Magic Shop'.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
