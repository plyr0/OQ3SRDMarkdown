# OQ3 SRD Creatures

## The Creature List

Each of the following creatures is described in the following format.

### Characteristics

These are the characteristics that the creature possesses. If a creature is missing a characteristic for any reason, the effect of this is noted under the Special rules section for that creature. Two scores are given for each characteristic. Firstly, the dice range which you can roll to determine an individual's characteristics randomly, and in brackets the score of an average individual of that species. This average score is used throughout the rest of the stats, so you can quickly pick up and use the creatures. If you randomly roll characteristics, you will have to adjust the rest of the skills and other characteristic dependent scores accordingly.

A creature with a randomly determined INT is considered sentient – it is a rational creation capable of logical thought and self-determination. A creature with a fixed INT (any INT listed as a single number, rather than a die roll) is not sentient. Fixed INT creatures operate solely on instinct rather than logic or intuition.

### Attributes

The grouping gives the hit points, damage modifier and magic points of the creature. Again, these are based upon the characteristic scores of an average member of the species. Also listed is the creature's movement rate (MR), with a note if the creature can fly or swim. The profile also gives typical armour worn, including the Armour Points (AP), as well as the creature's Loot Factor.

### Skills

Creatures have skills like player characters. This section breaks down into the skills categories and details the significant skills that an average member or this species will have. Combat skills have the damage listed, including damage modifier, and other details for the weapon used, in brackets next to the weapons name. Unless otherwise noted, a creature with multiple attack forms will only get to use one as its combat action.

### Magic

This section gives suggestions of the type of magic spells that an average member of the species will know.

### Special Rules

This section has details of other rules that apply to the creature. Its abilities are described where necessary.

## Creature Descriptions

### Basilisk

***Characteristics***

| STR | CON | DEX | SIZ | INT | POW | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2D3 | 2D6+6 | 2D6 | 1D3 | 3 | 1D6+12 | 3 |
| 4 | 13 | 7 | 2 | 3 | 16 | 3 |

***Attributes***

| Hit Points | Damage Modifier | Magic Points | MR | Armour | Loot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | -1D6 | 16 | 15m | Scales (2pt) | 5 |

***Skills***

Resistances: Dodge 30%, Persistence 50%, Resilience 70%.

Practical: Athletics 60%, Deception 40%.

Knowledge: Natural lore 40%.

***Combat***

Ranged Combat 100%: Gaze (Death, 1 CR, Range: POW in metres).

Unarmed Combat 30%: Bite (1D6–1D6+poison).

Note: The basilisk can attack with both gaze and bite simultaneously in the same action.

***Magic***

Basilisks do not learn magic.

***Special Rules***

_Corrosive Blood_: Any non-magical weapon hitting the basilisk corrodes in the creature's blood, completely disintegrating after 1D4 rounds.

The basilisk's poison and corrosive blood are magical effects, which lose their special properties a few minutes after leaving the basilisk's body, making it virtually impossible to use the creature as a source for making lethal compounds.

_Basilisk Venom_

Type: Ingested or smeared.

Delay: Immediate.

Potency: 65.

Full Effect: 1D4 Hit Point damage, applies –6 penalty to victim's CON.

Duration: 6D10 minutes.

_Death Gaze_: A basilisk can kill with a glance. In combat, the basilisk glares at a single opponent each round. If the basilisk overcomes the target in an opposed test of its Persistence against the target's Resilience, the target dies instantly. Using the gaze attack costs no magic points, and the basilisk may normally attack in any round in which it uses the gaze attack. This attack penetrates magical defences as if it were a Magnitude 6 Personal Magic spell. If the target successfully resists the gaze attack, they are unharmed, though they may be targeted again.

### Bloodweed

### Elemental

The only characteristic that an elemental has is SIZ; all of its derived attributes and skills are based on this.

***Elemental Scores***

| Size of Elemental | SIZ | Damage | Hit Points (=SIZ) | Attack (=SIZ x 5) | Area of attack (=SIZ /3) | MR | Dodge | Persistence | Resilience\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 3 | 1D6 | 3 | 25% | 1m | 15m | 100 | 30 | 100 |
| Medium | 9 | 2D6 | 9 | 45% | 3m | 20m | 90 | 60 | 100 |
| Large | 21 | 3D6 | 21 | 80% | 7m | 30m | 60 | 80 | 100 |
| Huge | 50 | 4D6 | 50 | 100% | 16m | 45m | 30 | 100 | 100 |

Elementals attack by engulfing their enemies. All opponents within the area of attack are potential targets. Elementals use their Attack percentage, which is equal to their size times five, to hit the target, who then resists using the resistance appropriate to the attack.

\*Elementals are immune to disease and poison.

| Elemental | Type of attack | Resistance used | Attribute damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Undines | Drown | Resilience | Hit Points |
| Shade | Fear | Persistence | Magic Points |
| Salamander | Burning | Resilience | Hit Points |
| Gnome | Crush | Resilience | Hit Points |
| Sylph | Bluster | Resilience | Hit Points |

Shades attack using Fear. When they reduce their opponent's Magic Point's total to zero, they literally die of shock.

***Other Elemental Abilities***

**See invisible:** Elementals have magical senses that allow them to 'see' invisible creatures, such as immaterial spirits. They also gain a +50% when detecting hidden characters.

**Almost invisible against the same element:** All elementals have the equivalent of a 90% Deception when lying next to an environment of the same element as themselves. For example, undines are nearly invisible when lying in a pool of water and gnomes can curl up and blend into a surrounding rocky area.

***Combat***

Close Combat 80%: War Maul (2D8+1D6).

Unarmed Combat 60%: Fist (1D6+1D6).

***Magic***

Since mummies are POW-less, they never have Personal Magic. Mummies who were priests in their previous lives may have Divine Magic, and mummies who know sorcery will always know at least one Tap spell to gain Magic Points to fuel their spells.

_Undead Sorcerer_. Sorcery Casting 75%: Tap POW, Mirage, Neutralise Magic, Venom.

***Special Rules***

An Ignite spell will work on a mummy's body. A strike with a fiery weapon, such as a sword with a Fireblade spell on it, or even a torch, will ignite the mummy if the hit causes damage. The damage done by the initial hit is taken each combat round as fire damage unless the fire is put out. To put out a fire, the mummy must take one combat round to roll on the ground or immerse itself in water. During this time, it may not make any other actions or reactions.

Healing spells are ineffective on mummies, though a Repair spell will fix any damage done (in 1D10 hit point increments).

When a creature becomes a mummy, its STR and CON are doubled. The statistics above represent a human mummy, though any sentient creature willing to undergo the process may become a mummy.

### Nymphs

Killing a nymph's physical body sends it back to the magic world to regenerate. The nymph, if unmolested in the magic world, will form a new body in her special place after 2D6 days, provided the place remains intact.

#### Dryad

A dryad is a nymph of a particular area of woodland, a grove of a radius in metres equal to twice her POW. The dryad cannot leave this territory. If she does, her physical body disintegrates into leaves and flowers, to reform in the magic world as above. Within a dryad's grove is a particular tree that they are mystically linked to; they will endure for as long as their personal tree endures, and no longer.

A dryad can form or dissolve her body by stepping out of or into this tree, though if a dryad's body is destroyed, it takes her time (as for any nymph) to form another.

***Special Rules***

A dryad controls all of the plants within her grove. She can cause them to move slowly, grow surprisingly rapidly, or blossom or bear fruit out of season. This power cannot be used as a direct attack.

#### Hag

Hags embody darkness and shadows. Hags are associated with caves and other dark areas seldom exposed to direct sunlight. A hag can only leave her domain when it is night and must return there before dawn; if she does not, her physical body is destroyed.

A hag's body is also destroyed if she is struck by direct sunlight. A hag may form and dissolve her body at will, although if her body is destroyed, it takes a hag time (as for any nymph) to form another.

***Characteristics***

***Special Rules***

A hag can create a shade out of the darkness of her lair. Doing this costs one magic point per point of SIZ the shade has. A hag can only manifest one shade at a time, though if it is destroyed she can create another.

#### Naiad

Naiads are nymphs of the water, whether a particular stream, stretch of river, lake, swamp or, occasionally, a part of the coastline.

For every ten metres a naiad moves from her body of water, she loses a magic point. If she reaches zero magic points, her body collapses into a pool of water and her spirit returns to her domain. A naiad can only regain magic points when completely submerged in water.

#### Oread

An oread is a nymph associated with a particular hill, mountain, or valley. For every ten metres an oread moves from her domain, she loses a magic point. If she reaches zero magic points, her body turns to stone and her spirit returns home.

_Scream_. Anyone in an area of fifty meters who can hear the Pentaghast's scream is subject to nausea and vomiting for 1D4 rounds on a failed Resilience roll. Once the targets have either successfully or unsuccessfully resisted the scream, they are no longer affected by it. Mocking laughter. Anyone who can hear the pentaghast's terrible laughter is subject to a Demoralize spell. The demon can laugh once every two combat rounds.

_Create Puppet._ Once per day a pentaghast is able to create a humanoid puppet out of dung. The puppet is guided by the pentaghast's will. Use a standard species template (e.g. human, dwarf, elf, orc, etc..) to provide stats and base skills for the puppet, but use the knowledge skills of the demon. Such puppets tend to be heavily scented with perfume, to hide the smell of the dung, so are only detected on a successful Perception test.

_The Gift of Tongues._ The Pentaghast is able to speak all languages and mimic flawlessly the speech of any person it has previously heard.

_Damage Immunity._ The Pentaghast is only damaged by magic and is immune to non-magical poisons and disease.

***Skills***

\*Immune to all mind control magic, poison and disease.

Practical: Athletics 30%, Perception 75%, Deception 75%.

***Combat***

Unarmed Combat 75%: Envelop (Acid damage equal to the Slime's SIZ).

***Magic***

Slimes do not learn magic.

***Special Rules***

A slime can only be killed by fire or magic. Normal weapons merely pass through the slime's rancid tissue, without causing damage. Because of a slime's caustic nature, neither acid nor poison has any effect on it. Non-fiery Weapon Enhance spells do no damage to a slime. Disruption and similar spells have their normal effect.

A slime's body retains its full acidic properties for a number of days after death equal to the creature's CON.

It attacks by moving next to its intended victim and attempting to envelop them. This attack has a base 75% chance of success, though the victim may use his Dodge skill or his Athletics skill to jump out of the way. Using Athletics rather than Dodge incurs a –40% penalty. A slime's attack may not be parried – the creature will simply slide around the parrying weapon to engulf its foe.

Every round a creature is enmeshed by a slime, that creature will take acid damage equal to the SIZ of the Slime. Armour will protect against this damage for the first round, after which it is dissolved by the Slime's acid unless it is enchanted in some way or another. A character caught by a slime may attempt to escape by making another Dodge or Athletics skill test.

The slime can also crawl up walls and hang from ceilings.

### Spirits

Spirits can engage in Spirit Combat with living creatures that have a POW characteristic. If they win the combat, they possess the loser, since spirits crave a physical body for a variety of reasons, depending on their type. For example, disease spirits possess their victims and riddle their bodies with foul disease. See Spirit Possession in Combat chapter for more information.

Spirits lack a physical presence, due to lack of STR, CON and DEX.

#### Disease Spirit

Resistances: Dodge 40%, Persistence 50%.

Knowledge: Lore (Disease) 100%, Lore (Spirit World) 40%.

Practical: Deception 30%.

Spirit Combat 50%: Spectral Claw (1D6).

***Special Rules***

A disease spirit is, in essence, a disease, either mundane or magical. After covertly possessing its victim, the possessed one will be forced to make Resilience tests to resist the effects of the disease. The disease cannot be thrown off until the disease spirit is ousted. Also, the spirit will nearly always choose to apply its POW as a penalty to the possessed one's Resilience tests.

If the possessed one dies while being possessed by a disease spirit, there is a percentage chance equal to the spirit's POW that they will arise as a new disease spirit in 2D6 hours.

#### Ghost

Those that should have passed into the afterlife, but who have not found peace, remain to haunt the living as ghosts. Jealous and mean, they seek to do harm to the living and often will try to possess a victim to experience the joys of living once again.

***Special Rules***

Ghosts can only be affected by magic spells which either dominate or drive them off, or by characters who can engage in Spirit Combat.

Knowledge: Lore (Disease) 100%, Lore (Spirit World) 60%.

Spirit Combat 50%: Spiritual Blast 1D6.

***Special Rules***

The natural enemy of disease spirits, a healing spirit is only capable of entering Spirit Combat with a disease spirit already covertly possessing a creature. If the healing spirit can bring the disease spirit to zero Hit Points, it will force it to leave its host. The healing spirit will then depart as well, for it cannot permanently possess any creature.

If a healing spirit is used on an individual who is sick from a mundane illness (rather than from a disease spirit), it will add its POW as a percentage bonus to the individual's chance of success on their next Resilience test to throw off the effects of the disease.

#### Magic Spirit

Magic spirits are spirits that have mastery of one or more spells. If bound, the holder of the spirit may use the spirit's Magic Points for casting spells.

Magic spirits may not initiate spirit combat but may use the spells it knows to attack or defend itself.

They appear as a series of multi-coloured orbs, equal in number to the number of spells they know.

***Magic***

A magic spirit knows 1D6 Personal Magic, Divine Magic or Sorcery spells. These spirits will only know one spell type. For example, a magic spirit will not have both Divine and Sorcery spells, nor may it ever learn spells of another type. If the spirit casts Divine Magic, it must regain the use of spent spells in the same way a priest does. If casting Sorcery or Personal Magic, it has a casting skill equal to its POW x 5.

If a fear spirit covertly possesses a host, the host becomes permanently Demoralised (as the spell), until the spirit is cast out.

##### **Madness Spirit**

If a madness spirit succeeds in covertly possessing a victim, it will manifest itself in daily bouts of insanity. At least once per day, the madness spirit will attempt to cause an insane fit in its host. It matches its Persistence against the host's Resilience in a standard opposed test. If the host succeeds, the madness spirit will be quiescent for at least a number of hours equal to the host's POW.

If the host fails, he becomes incapacitated for 1D20 hours – screaming madly, giggling incoherently or simply becoming catatonic for the duration of the effect. The madness spirit chooses the manner of madness, though most are partial to a single effect. The madness spirit will also attempt to assert itself whenever its host is in a stressful situation. Combat is an obvious example, but these spirits also delight in affecting their hosts in a variety of other stressful, important situations – collapsing into a fit of mad giggling while petitioning an unfriendly king for a boon is exactly the kind of thing madness spirits enjoy. Note, if the stressful situation occurs during a period of forced quiescence on the part of the spirit, it will be unable to manifest itself.

##### **Pain Spirit**

If a pain spirit manages to possess its target covertly, the victim will be overcome with a sudden burst of pain. From that point on, until the spirit is cast out, the victim will always be conscious of a dull ache in his joints or a twinge in his muscles. Whenever the host acts quickly (as in combat) or concentrates (as in spell casting), and sometimes purely at random intervals, he is struck by a sudden spasm of pain. This pain reduces all the host's skill tests by a penalty equal to the spirit's POW.

For example, if a pain spirit with a POW of 17 possesses a victim, that victim loses 17% from all skill tests so long as the spirit possesses him. If they had an Athletics skill of 90%, were attempting to climb a cliff and rolled an 80, the test would be a failure as the pain spirit effectively reduces their skill to 73%.

_Vampire Lord Priest_

Personal Magic Casting 75%: Darkwall, Tongues.

Divine Magic: Fear, Touch of Death.

_Vampire Lord Sorcerer_

Sorcery Casting 75%: Dominate Humans, Energy Projection (Cold), Mystic Vision, Neutralise Magic, Venom.

***Special rules***

_Night vision._ Vampires can see in the dark and at night as if it were day by sensing life energy.

_Magic Point Drain._ A vampire does not regenerate Hit Points or Magic Points normally. Instead, they must take them from other beings by draining their blood. On a successful bite attack, the vampire will hang on and drain D6 Magic Points from the victim every round. Each drained Magic Point gives the vampire one Hit Point or Magic Point (vampire's choice). When the Vampire drains the victim's Magic Points to 0, the victim falls unconscious, as normal, and the vampire can choose to carry on draining blood, except now it's the victim's permanent POW that is drained.

_Shapeshifting._ Vampires have the ability to shapeshift into mist at will. As a single Combat Action, the vampire (and every non-living item on his person) dissolves into a thin greenish fog, approximately the same SIZ as they were in the flesh. As a mist, the vampire is immune to all types of physical damage, but cannot take any action except moving up to their MR. In mist form, a vampire moves at the same speed as they would normally and is unaffected by strong winds. Additionally, vampires still take damage from sunlight in mist form.

As well as the ability to transform into mist, some vampires manifest the ability to shapeshift into wolves and bats as well. As with the mist transformation, such changes take a Combat Action to perform.

Upon death, the vampire collapses to the ground and turns to mist at the beginning of the next Combat Round. Before then, it can be destroyed permanently by driving a stake through its heart (the only way to prevent it from turning to mist) and decapitating it.

_Vampires and Sunlight._ As creatures of the night, vampires cannot stand the touch of natural sunlight. They take one point of damage to every hit location per round that they are exposed to the sun, though some will risk travelling in the daylight hours by wearing layers of clothing and a hood to cover as much of their body as possible.

_Holy symbols._ In the past, the holy icons of some religion have proved effective against vampires. Those that focus their energies against the undead are the most likely to be effective. It is down to the Referee to decide what supernaturally offends any particular vampire. An elven vampire, for example, might be repelled by symbols of nature gods, rather than by human symbols of holiness. Any character presenting a holy symbol to a vampire as a Combat Action matches their Persistence against the vampire's Resilience in an opposed check. They will receive bonuses or penalties at the Referee's discretion, based on the appropriateness of the symbol being displayed. On a successful test, the vampire loses 1D4 Hit Points (unaffected by armour or any of the vampire's magic) and may not attack that character or any other character under the protection of Holy Symbol.

### Werewolf

This being is human by day, but when the rage takes them, or under a full moon, they transform into a giant savage wolf. Werewolves are the very embodiment of nature or the bane of humanity, depending on your viewpoint.

***Characteristics***

| STR | CON | DEX | SIZ | INT | POW | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3D6 (x2 as wolf) | 3D6 | 3D6 | 2D6+6 | 2D6+6 (x0.5 as wolf) | 3D6 | 3D6 |

***Attributes***

| Hit Points | Damage Modifier | Magic Points | MR | Armour | Loot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | +1D6 in wolf form | 11 | 15m as man, 30m in wolf form | Hide (1 AP) | 0 |

***Skills***

Resistances: Dodge 60%, Persistence 60%, Resilience 60%.

Knowledge: Natural Lore 80%.

Practical: Athletics 60%, Deception 60%, Perception 60%.

***Combat***

Close Combat 35% (as human): Longsword (1D8).

Ranged Combat 25% (as human): Short Bow (1D8, 1 CR, 75m).

Unarmed Combat 60% (as wolf): Bite (1D8+1D4), Claw (1D6+1D4).

***Magic***

Werewolves either learn Personal Magic handed down from their ancestors to their family, a grouping known as the pack, or join an Earth religion of a particularly rough and savage nature.

_Initiate of the Wolf Lord_

Personal Magic: Beast Call [2], Fanaticism [2], Coordination 3, Healing 3.

Divine Magic: Berserk.

***Special Rules***

_Night Vision._ Werewolves have night vision, and at night they can see as well as they can during the day.

_Shape-Shifting._ Werewolves can change form at will, an act that requires a Combat Round to complete. On nights of a full moon, werewolves have no choice but to assume beast form.

While in wolf form, werewolves are immune to most damage. Only magic, fire or weapons made of pure silver will harm them – all other blows simply bounce off harmlessly. If a normal sword with a Weapon Enhance 3 spell cast on it is used against a werewolf, only the three points of damage from the spell will affect the creature; the weapon's normal damage, as well as the attacker's Damage Modifier, do not count. The werewolf's thick skin, which grants the beast one point of armour, would reduce the Weapon Enhance spell's damage to two. If the entire weapon is enchanted, such as with a Fireblade spell, the entire damage rolled will count, though the wielder's Damage Modifier will still be ignored.

Werewolves can be poisoned, so long as the poison can be introduced to the creature's body. They are living entities who require oxygen and thus may be asphyxiated or drowned.

## The Animal List

This list describes more mundane animals. It lists domestic animals (such as horses and cattle), as well as wild beasts. Some of the animals are in their 'Giant' form, which are more threatening opponents than their normal sized versions.

None of the animals listed here have any treasure by design. They may have some as determined by the Referee as fits the needs of the story. For example, a carnivore may have a few trinkets in the remains of its previous meals.

All the animals listed here have fixed INT and therefore not sentient. None of them knows any magic.
