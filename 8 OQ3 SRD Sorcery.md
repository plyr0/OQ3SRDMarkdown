# OQ3 SRD Sorcery

## Types of Sorcerer

Practitioners of Sorcery develop in one of two ways. The majority of sorcerers belong to schools of sorcery, which have books of spells and rules that they teach their apprentices. Alternatively, there is a long tradition of practitioners working in solitude, cut off from other Sorcerers and society at large, to focus purely on their magical activities. Occasionally such solitary Sorcerers take on an apprentice, to teach their art to, or simply as a helping hand around the magical laboratory.

### Example School: The University of Wizardry

_Benefits:_ Free board and lodging at all University Hostelries and forts.

_For an Adept or Magus_

Rescue or ransom will be paid if captured.

_Duties:_ Uphold the laws of the University.

Oppose and expose heretical sorcerers.

_Sorcery taught:_ Animate (Substance), Cast Back, Create Spell Matrix, Create Scroll, Damage Boosting, Damage Resistance, Dominate (Orc), Dominate (Goblin), Energy Projection (Fire), Enhance (STR), Enhance (DEX), Mystic Vision, Neutralise Magic, Palsy, Protective Sphere, Sight Projection, Spell Resistance, Summon (Magic Spirit), Treat Wounds.

_Prohibited Magic:_ Tap (characteristic), Summon Demon or Undead, Venom.

### Example Solo Sorcerer. The Sorcerer who Lives in the Tower

This is an Adept close to becoming a Magus (he has Sorcery Casting 85% and needs 95%), who lives in an isolated village on the border. He lives in an old ruined tower, just outside the village, conducting magical experiments and ensuring the safety of the village from 'Things from Beyond'. Most of the villagers think he is a mad fool, but are not beyond seeking out his services, of healing and exorcism, when beset by the strange magical horrors

_Sorcery Spells known:_ Cast Back, Create Spell Matrix, Create Scroll, Damage Boosting, Damage Resistance, Diminish (SIZ), Dominate (Spirit), Energy Projection (Cold), Fly, Mirage, Neutralise Magic, Protective Sphere, Shape change (Man) to (Wolf), Skin of Life, Spell Resistance, Spirit Resistance, Summon Elemental, Summon Spirit, Treat wounds.

_Prohibited Magic: Tap (characteristic), Venom._

## Ranks of Sorcery

There are three basic ranks of Sorcerers.

_Apprentices_ (Sorcery Casting 25% and up). Those who are learning the laws of Sorcery and their application.

_Adepts_ (minimum of Sorcery Casting 50%). Those who have a firm grasp of the basics and are making firm progress towards the true pinnacle of achievement.

_Magus_ (minimum of Sorcery Casting 90%). Those who have mastered the arts of Sorcery and have used its power to transcend the limitations of life itself.

### Apprentices

These are students of Sorcery who will only know a couple of spells, including Mystic Vision. As well as being taught the arts of Sorcery via book learning, attending practical classes or conducting practical fieldwork that their masters consider the foundations of their learning, they also spend a large amount of their time doing drudge work, cleaning up, doing the heavy lifting and other physical tasks that their teachers consider themselves above.

_Requirements:_ To become an Apprentice, as well as meeting the Sorcery Casting requirement of a minimum skill of 25%, the character must spend two growth points.

_Benefits:_ Apprentices learn the spell Mystic Vision, which is the fundamental method of discerning the Laws of Sorcery in action, for free, and they are shown how to create a sorcerer's wand.

#### The Sorcerer's Wand

The classic wand is a slender rod of hardwood about the length of the owner's forearm. The wand is created for the apprentice by their mentor, who enchants the wand for the new apprentice.

The wand focuses up to two spells that the character knows. These spells can be changed in the downtime between adventures, and have a star placed against the spell name on the character sheet to show they are focused. Spells that are focused by the wand increase the character's Sorcery Casting skill when casting them with the wand (+20% when used to all casting tests).

The character is aware of where the wand is at all times and the enchantments placed upon the wand makes it indestructible.

### Adepts

These are full graduates of the schools of Sorcery, or equivalent, taught by a solo sorcerer who acknowledges their autonomy and ability to practice Sorcery without constant supervision. They will know between five and ten spells and will have a Sorcery Casting skill ranging from 50% to 90%. If a member of a school of Sorcery, they will be expected to spend 30% of their time performing duties for the school, such as teaching apprentices or recovering lost magical knowledge. If a former apprentice of a solo sorcerer, they will probably start taking over whatever duties their mentor is giving up (due to old age or deepening studies towards becoming a Magus).

_Requirements:_ To become an Adept the character must have a minimum of 50% in Sorcery Casting, a POW of at least 15 and know at least five spells.

#### Benefits of becoming an Adept

#### The Sorcerer's Stone

Would-be Adepts know how to create their sorcerer's stone when they reach Sorcery Casting of 50%, and do so as part of the ceremony where they rise to Adepthood.

The sorcerer's stone takes the form of a large magic crystal, about the size of a fist, which is primarily a magic point store. It can store up to the character's current POW in magic points.

#### The Sorcerer's Staff

Sorcerers of Adept rank are more active in the Real World and spend more time travelling around. So, they need a more obvious symbol of their power than the small and slender wand. Therefore, every Adept creates a sorcerer's staff when they rise to this rank.

- It acts as a spell focus, like a wand, but it's not limited to two spells – the staff focuses one spell per ten points of Sorcery Casting.
- Any spells that are focused by the character's wand may also be focused on by the staff. Many Adepts keep their wands and use them for magic casting at home.
- Like the wand, the staff is indestructible, and the sorcerer knows where it is at all times.
- The sorcerer may mount their sorcerer's stone at the end of the staff.
- Finally, the staff is two-handed and can be used in close combat doing 1D10 damage.

#### The Sorcerer's Familiar

Upon becoming an Adept, Sorcerers may also create a familiar from a standard animal.

Use an animal as a template for stats.

- The familiar is in permanent Mindlink with the sorcerer, with a range as determined by the sorcerer's Range Magnitude.
- Part of the ritual to create the familiar awakens its Intelligence, which becomes equal to the sorcerer's INT.
- A familiar's characteristics, skills and magic can be increased by the player spending growth points, as they would for the character.
- The player of the sorcerer who created the familiar also runs the familiar.
- If killed, all the growth points that went towards creating and improving the familiar return to the character's pool of unspent growth points.

#### Create and Teach Apprentice

Adepts can perform the rituals and create wands to induct Apprentices into the art of Sorcery. They can then teach them Sorcery spells.

Sorcerers do not teach non-sorcerers Sorcery. Instead, would-be students need to become Apprentices and learn the fundamental principles.

### Magus

A Magus is an acknowledged master of Sorcery. They have at least ten spells and a Sorcery Casting skill of 90%+. If a character meets these requirements, the player can spend ten growth points to gain this rank. If a member of a school of Sorcery, the magus serves on its ruling body and has the complete resources of the school at their command. In return, they spend 90% of their time researching, teaching, and performing missions on the school's behalf.

#### Transcendence

The Magus has such high knowledge of the laws of Sorcery that they are no longer part of the Real World. Their body changes from a physical one, based upon CON and SIZ with hit points, to one based on pure magical energy, based upon POW and magic points.

Consequently, they are immune to disease and poison, unless they specifically target POW or magic points, and instead of taking damage to hit points, they take them to magic points.

Spells which heal a physical body, such as Heal, Treat Wounds, and Divine Heal, do not work on the Magus' new magical form. Instead, a Magus will transfer stored magic points, such as those held in their Sorcerer's Stone, back into their magical body. This takes one combat round and is an action that requires full concentration to complete.

Defensive spells that protect against physical harm, such as Damage Resistance, still do so. As does physical armour, although a Magus is more likely to use magical means to protect themselves.

The appearance of their new magical body takes the form of the Magus at their most ideal. This form has a glowing halo around it, which is obvious to any onlooker.

The character no longer ages physically and is considered immortal.

Since they are made of pure magical energy, they also are easily detectable using Find Magic and other magic detection spells.

For many player characters, Transcending is the end of their story in-game, with the player retiring the character from play. If the player has ideas of how the Transcended character can continue, they should discuss that with their Referee to work out further adventures. Most non-player character Transcended Masters choose to withdraw from the Real World, using their new magical body to explore Other Worlds and the other avenues of magical power that open up to them. They often maintain a link with the Real World, where favoured students can contact them for sentimental reasons.

## Learning Sorcery

Before a spell can be cast using Sorcery, the following process must be followed:

The character must first learn the spell through research. To learn a particular Sorcery spell, the caster must possess the spell in written form or be taught it by a teacher. The player then spends three Growth points and writes the spell down on their character sheet.

The Sorcery Casting magical skill governs each Sorcery spell. This skill is automatically acquired at its basic score (INT) when the character is first created. This skill may be improved normally, through the use of growth points. Even non-sorcerers have this skill, at its base value, since it is used to give them a chance to use sorcerous magic items and scrolls that store Sorcery spells.

Once the Sorcery spell has been learned, the character will be ready to try casting it.

## Conversion to Sorcery

This procedure affects characters who are Personal Magic and Divine Magic users who want to learn Sorcery.

Sorcery is not a compatible philosophy with Personal Magic or Divine Magic. Personal Magic is a haphazard set of techniques, and anyone becoming an Apprentice must give it up. Likewise, the allied magician type of Shaman or Wise. Similarly, Divine Magic is the passionate and faith-based belief in the power of the gods, which has no place alongside the rationality of Sorcery which believes that gods are merely thought-forms given power by their worshippers.

When a character who possesses either Divine or Personal Magic wants to learn Sorcery, they convert to Sorcery's world view on how magic works. They unlearn any Divine or Personal Magic spells that they know, spending the freed up growth points to learn new spells, advance Sorcery Casting and to pay for any advancement in Rank in Sorcery.

## Casting Sorcery Spells

A character must be able to gesture with their hands and be able to chant to cast a spell. Whenever a spell is cast using Sorcery, there will always be a sight and sound that nearby creatures can detect, be it a flash of light, a crack of thunder or a shimmering in the air. The exact effects are up to the Referee and player to decide, but they will automatically be seen and heard by any creatures within ten times the magnitude of the spell in metres.

If casting a Sorcery spell in a stressful situation, like in the middle of combat or if the Sorcerer is casting it as an on-the-spot reaction to a dangerous situation, requires a successful skill test using the Sorcery Casting skill. If successful, the spell takes effect. Like other skill use, if the sorcerer is casting the spell in a calm situation, away from danger, then the spell does not require a Sorcery Casting test.

If the casting test fails, the spell does not take effect, and the caster loses one magic point.

The only thing a character can do while casting a spell is walk up to half their movement rate.

A spell takes effect at the end of its casting, which starts at the beginning of the combat round and ends on the Sorcery Casting skill of the caster in the combat order. Note, while spell casting a character will draw possible attacks from enemies that are adjacent to them during a combat round.

Distractions or attacks on the sorcerer as they cast will require Persistence tests for them to maintain concentration on the spell.

### Magic Points

All Sorcery spells cost a base of one magic point to cast. If a manipulated, each effect costs extra magic points to apply.

### Casting Critical Successes

If a Sorcery Casting test results in a critical success, then any attempts to resist or counter the spell suffer a –25% penalty and the magic point cost for applying any manipulation effect costs nothing.

### Casting Fumbles

If a Sorcery Casting test results in a fumble, then the spell fails and the Sorcerer loses the full cost of the spell, including manipulation effects, as if it had been successfully cast.

### Manipulation of Sorcery Spells

Sorcery spells have three basic effects which can be manipulated by the sorcerer: magnitude, duration and range.

Each effect has a default value which the spell can be cast at, costing one magic point. The Manipulation table gives the default value for the spell effects.

Before the spell casting, the player decides which effects to manipulate and works out the extra magic point cost.

***Manipulation cost***

| Sorcery Skill % | Magic Point cost | Magnitude | Duration | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any (Default traits) | 1 | 1 | 5 minutes | 10 m |
| 01-10% | +1 | 2 | 15 minutes | 20 m |
| 11-20% | +2 | 3 | 1 hour | 50 m |
| 21-30% | +3 | 4 | 6 hours | 250 m |
| 31-40% | +4 | 5 | 12 hours | 500m |
| 41-50% | +5 | 6 | 1 day | 1 km |
| 51-60% | +6 | 7 | 1 week | 10 km |
| 61-70% | +7 | 8 | 1 month | 100 km |
| 71-80% | +8 | 9 | 1 season | 1000 km |
| 81-90% | +9 | 10 | 1 year | 5000 km |
| 91-99% | +10 | 15 | 5 Years | 10,000 km |
| 100% | +10 | 20 | Permanent | Planetary |

#### Where do Sorcerers get all the Magic Points they Need for Manipulated Spells?

A sorcerer can cast a spell which needs more magic points in its manipulated form than a sorcerer will normally have. Sorcerers get round this by storing magic points in their Sorcerer's Stone or using bound Magic Spirits (through a combination of Summon Magic Spirit, then Dominate Magic Spirit) to provide magic points.

#### Can Spells be Further Manipulated Once Cast?

No. Once you've cast a particular spell on a particular recipient it stays in place until dispelled, by either the caster (at will) or an opponent casting some sort of dispel magic spell, such as Neutralise Magic. Neither the original caster or another Sorcerer can go back and add more magic points to increase its magnitude, range or duration further.

#### Masters and Manipulation

As you can see from the table above, once a Sorcerer gets to 100% casting the manipulation effects suddenly go off the charts. This reflects the fact that Masters are so in tune with the magical flow of the Universe that they are almost godlike in their ability to bend the Universe to their will.

## Spell Traits

The traits used by Sorcery spells are detailed below.

_Concentration:_ The spell's effects will remain in place as long as the character concentrates on it. Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the spell caster to continue to gesture with both arms, chant and to ignore distractions. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default duration.

_Instant:_ The spell's effects take place instantly. The spell itself then disappears. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default duration.

_Permanent:_ The spell's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default duration.

_Resist (Dodge/Persistence/Resilience):_ The spell's effects do not take effect automatically. The target may make a Dodge, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Dodge) spells require the target to be able to use Reactions to Dodge. In the case of Area spells, the Resist (Dodge) trait requires the target to dive to mitigate the spell's effect.

_Touch:_ These spells require the character to actually touch their target for the spell to take effect. The spell caster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting. This trait overrides the normal Sorcery spell default range.

**Defaults**

Sorcery spells tend to have far fewer traits than other types of magic. This is because most Sorcery spells share the same basic qualities: A duration equal to 5 minutes, a magnitude of 1, a range equal to 10 metres, and the default Sorcery spell will only affect one target.

## Spell Descriptions

### Animate (Substance)

Concentration

This spell allows the sorcerer to animate the substance indicated, up to one SIZ for every point of magnitude. The sorcerer can cause it to move about and interact, albeit relatively clumsily (Movement of 1m per three points of magnitude).

The sorcerer's chance to have the animated object perform any physical skill successfully is equal to half their own chance to perform that action (before any modifiers). If the appropriate Form/Set spell is cast immediately after this spell, the caster can perform much finer manipulation of the object. In this case, the animated object will use the caster's full skill scores for physical activities.

This spell can only be used on inanimate matter.

### Cast Back

This protective spell shields the caster from hostile magic and has a chance of sending it back to the attacking spell caster.

Cast Back only affects spells that target the user specifically and have the Resist trait. Such spells may affect the protected character normally, but if it is resisted, the spell is launched back at the person who cast it, as long as its magnitude is not greater than the Cast Back's magnitude.

### Create Godform (Deity)

Touch

This spell can be cast on a recipient other than the caster. It allows the recipient to assume the magical form of the deity for the duration of the spell. While not quite the same as becoming the god itself, it allows the recipient to assume some of the powers of the deity.

While the spell is in operation, the recipient gains:

+20% in all the skills that the deity teaches.

Each magnitude of the spell beyond the first allows the recipient to learn and cast one point of the deity's Divine or Personal Magic for the duration of the spell. Divine Magic is one use, and Personal Magic must be paid for from the recipients' magic points.

The recipient knows anything the deity would know.

This is an exceptionally powerful spell, whose use and knowledge automatically puts the sorcerer on the enemy list of the deity's cult, should they find out that the sorcerer knows how to Godform their god.

If the spell is fumbled, one of the following events, or one similar from the Referee's fertile imagination, occurs:

The deity sends one of its guardians, an Otherworld servant, to exact divine vengeance upon the sorcerer.

The deity transports the sorcerer and all 'helpers' to their court in the Houses of the Holy to explain themselves.

The deity tells a local priest of the sorcerer's heresy and makes it clear that it is their temple's job to exact revenge on their deity's behalf.

### Damage Boosting

Touch

This spell can be cast upon any weapon up to 5 ENC. Each point of magnitude adds one point to the weapon's damage (e.g. the basic spell will increase a hatchet from 1D6 damage to 1D6+1 damage).

### Damage Resistance

Touch

This spell protects the body of the recipient. Any incoming attack dealing damage equal to or less than the magnitude of the spell is ignored. Any incoming attack dealing more damage than the magnitude of Damage Resistance is unaffected and will deal its full damage as normal. Note, the protected character may still suffer from Knockback if applicable.

Damage Resistance may be combined with the Divine Magic spell Shield, in which case incoming damage is compared to the Damage Resistance spell first and only encounters the Shield spell if the Damage Resistance is bypassed.

### Diminish (characteristic)

Resist (Persistence/Resilience), Touch

There are seven Diminish spells, one for each characteristic. The spell will temporarily apply a penalty to the specified characteristic equal to the magnitude of the spell. The penalty applied by this spell may not reduce a characteristic below one, and a creature must have the characteristic in question to be affected by this spell.

Diminish (STR, DEX, CON and SIZ) are resisted with Resilience. Diminish (INT, POW and CHA) are resisted with Persistence.

Applying a penalty to POW does not reduce the character's magic points.

Note that not all uses of this spell are malicious. Thieves and others often value the timely use of a Diminish (SIZ) spell, as it can greatly enhance their ability to enter restricted areas.

### Dominate (Species)

Resist (Persistence)

This spell allows the caster to gain control over a creature belonging to a specific species. If the target fails to resist the spell, it must obey the commands of the caster for the duration of the spell.

The controlled creature shares a telepathic link with the sorcerer by which it can receive its orders. If the sorcerer and the creature dominated do not share a common language, the sorcerer can order it about, by forming a mental image of the actions they wish the dominated creature to perform.

### Energy Projection (Type)

Ranged, Instant, Resist (Dodge)
 Energy is either projected as a beam or a ball towards the target, who can avoid the attack by Dodging.

If the spell takes effect, the target takes damage equal to double the magnitude of the spell. Physical armour does not protect against the damage, but magical protection does. Types of energy that can be projected by this spell are Cold (Dark), Lightning, Heat (Fire), Shards of Rock (Earth), Windblast (Air).

### Enhance (characteristic)

Touch

There are seven Enhance spells, one for each characteristic. Essentially the reverse of the Diminish spell, Enhance allows the Sorcerer to temporarily apply a bonus to the specified characteristic equal to the magnitude of the spell. A creature must have the characteristic in question to be affected by this spell.

Applying a bonus to POW does not increase the character's magic points.

### Fly

Concentration, Resist (Persistence)

Using this spell allows the caster (or whomever or whatever they target with the spell) to fly. The caster may levitate objects or characters (the caster counting as one of these characters if they so wish).

A levitated character may not be overloaded and must have a SIZ characteristic which is lower than the sorcerer's POW characteristic.

Objects must have an ENC lower than the sorcerer's POW characteristic.

Character or objects moved by this spell have a base Movement Rate of 6m. All objects and characters moved by this spell move at the spell caster's behest, not their own.

Each point of the spell's magnitude may either be used to increase the target's Movement by +2m or to target an additional object or character – but not both. A sorcerer casting this spell at magnitude 4 may fly themselves with a Movement of 14m, fly themselves and a friend with a Movement of 10m each, or fly themselves and three friends with a Movement of 6m each.

### Form/Set (Substance)

Instant

There is an unlimited number of Form/Set spells in existence, one for every substance imaginable, from steel to smoke to water.

Each point of magnitude allows the caster to shape one ENC of solid substance or one cubic metre of an ethereal substance (like darkness). The caster must be familiar with the shape they are forming.

When the caster has finished the forming process, the substance retains its shape. Rigid substances like steel will hold the form they had at the end of the spell, while more mutable substances like water will immediately lose their shape.

This spell can be used to mend the damage done to an object. The sorcerer must form the entire object and must succeed at an appropriate Craft test. If successful they will restore the item to its original condition.

This spell can only be used on inanimate substances.

### Glow

This spell causes a glowing point of light to appear on a solid substance. At its base, the spell creates an area of light one metre in radius, giving off the same illumination as a candle. Each additional point of magnitude increases the radius of effect by one metre. At magnitude 3, the brightness of the spell increases to that of a flaming brand at its centre. At magnitude 5, it increases to that of a camp-fire and at magnitude 10 to that of a bonfire.

This spell can be cast on an opponent's eyes. If cast on a living being, the spell also gains the Resist (Dodge) trait. If the target fails to resist it, they will suffer a penalty to all attack, parry and Dodge tests, as well as any skills relying upon vision, equal to five times the spell's magnitude, until the spell ends or is dispelled.

### Hamper

Resist (Resilience)

Each point of magnitude of Hamper subtracts 1m from the Movement rate of the target. Every two points of magnitude also subtract -10% from a recipient's skills for the purposes of determining the order in combat.

### Haste

Each point of magnitude of Haste adds 1m to the Movement rate of the recipient. Every two points of magnitude also add +10% to the recipient's skills for the purposes of determining the order in combat.

### Holdfast

Touch

This spell causes two adjacent ten centimetres by ten centimetre surfaces (roughly the size of a person's palm) to commingle into one. The basic bond has a STR of 1. Each additional point of magnitude will either increase the STR of the bond by +1 or double the area affected.

This spell can affect organic and inorganic substances. If the caster is attempting to bond a living being with this spell, the spell gains the Resist (Resilience) trait.

### Make Potion

Permanent

Using the arts of alchemy, Sorcerers can store Sorcery spells in a liquid known as a Potion.

All potions have an attached cost of 1 Gold Ducat per magnitude of spell in ingredients. Multiple spells may be stored in one potion, with the understanding that they will all be cast when the potion is drunk at the magnitude that the creator originally put into the potion.

### Make Scroll

Permanent

Magical scrolls are written items that store Sorcery spells. All scrolls have an attached cost of 1 Gold Ducat per magnitude of spell in ingredients (for special inks/parchments, etc.).

The resulting scroll is a one-use item which, upon a successful Sorcery Casting test, casts the spell(s) with any included manipulations at the magnitude that was cast on the scroll.

Alternatively, upon a successful Sorcery Casting skill test, the reader of the scroll can learn the spell by spending the appropriate number of _Growth point_s.

Either way, upon the successful use of the scroll, the spell fades from the scroll. If the casting roll merely fails, the spell remains, but the reader cannot attempt to use the scroll until their Sorcery Casting skill increases. If the casting roll is fumbled, the spell fades from the scroll, without any benefit to the reader.

### Make Spell Matrix

Permanent

This spell creates items that store Sorcery spells.

All spell matrices have an attached cost of 10 Gold Ducats per spell in special materials.

The enchanter pays 1 Growth point per spell stored in the matrix.

The wielder can cast and manipulate the spell at the skill of the original enchanter, using their own magic points as fuel.

Spell matrices are reusable and permanent.

Spell matrices are mundane items in their own right and if the item is broken, the spell is dispelled. However, at the time of enchantment, the enchanter can spend another growth point to magically harden the item, making it indestructible.

### Mirage

This is the Sorcerers' version of Illusion.

This spell creates an illusion based on all five senses. The illusion will seem real and solid unless the person looking at it succeeds in a Perception test, which is subject to a modifier based on the magnitude of the spell. If the viewer succeeds in a Perception test, and the illusion could usually cause damage if believed in, it can no longer cause damage to that character. As soon as a viewer disbelieves the illusion, it becomes insubstantial and ghost-like to them.

The size of the illusion is also governed by the magnitude. A magnitude 1 Illusion can be used to create small household items, say a fake table and chair, but would not be able to create an illusion of a fire-breathing dragon.

| Magnitude | Modifier to Perception test | Type of illusion possible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | +50 % | Not capable of motion or causing damage. Slightly fuzzy and unreal around the edges. Limit of SIZ 10. |
| 2 | +25 % | Some minor discrepancies. Capable of motion, but not of damage. Limit of SIZ 15. |
| 3 | 0 | Capable of motion and causing damage. Limit of SIZ 20. |
| 4 | -25 % | Capable of motion and causing damage. Limit of SIZ 30. |
| 5 | -50 % | Indistinguishable from the real thing, capable of motion and damage. Limit of SIZ 40. |
| +1 | -50% | +10 SIZ per magnitude. |

### Mystic Vision

Concentration

This spell allows the recipient to literally see magic. By augmenting the recipient's natural vision, the spell allows them to see a creature's magic points, as well as enchanted items with their own magic points or spells. The recipient must be able to see the creature or object for this spell to work. Mystic Vision also allows a recipient to see into the Spirit World.

On a normal success, the recipient of the spell will only know roughly how many magic points an object or creature has (1–10, 11–20, 21–30 and so forth). On a critical, they will know the exact amount. On a fumble, the Referee should give the player a misleading total.

By looking at a spell's effect, a recipient of Mystic Vision will automatically be aware of its magical origin (Divine Magic, Personal Magic, or Sorcery). By increasing the magnitude of Mystic Vision, the caster can learn more about what they are seeing. Compare the magnitude of Mystic Vision to the magnitude of any spell that the target is either casting or under the influence of. As long as Mystic Vision's magnitude exceeds the other spell's, the caster will be able to precisely determine the effects of the perceived spell, and a mental image of who cast the spell (if it is not obvious).

By looking at an enchanted item, a recipient of Mystic Vision will automatically be aware of its gross magical effects (such as the types of enchantment currently on the item). Each point of magnitude of Mystic Vision will also determine either the invested POW (and therefore the relevant strength) of a particular enchantment or a particular condition laid upon an enchantment (Referee's choice).

### Neutralise Magic

Instant

This spell allows a caster to neutralise other spells. Neutralise Magic will eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its own magnitude, starting with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate the most powerful spell, then it will instead target the second-most powerful spell. As soon as Neutralise Magic can no longer dismiss a target's spells, because all the remaining spell's magnitudes are too high, its effects immediately end.

Neutralise Magic can be fired as a Reaction, but only when another spell that the character wishes to counter is cast within Neutralise Magic's range. A successful Neutralise Magic disrupts the other spell and nullifies it. As long as Neutralise Magic's magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell's magnitude, the target spell is countered.

### Other World Portal (Other World)

This spell creates a portal to a named Other World. The magnitude of the spell is the number of creatures (of SIZ range 12-18) who can use the portal simultaneously. The portal exists as long as the spell is in effect. When the spell's duration is reached, the portal closes instantly.

If the spell casting is fumbled, catastrophic events occur. Here are some example events. The creative Referee is encouraged to create more.

A malignant creature from that Other World emerges and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close the portal.

The sorcerer and all within 10m of them are sucked through the portal, which then promptly closes. Worse, the Sorcerer is so befuddled that they cannot remember this spell for D20+D4 hours.

The Other World, to which the portal is connected, invades the home reality in a 1D10 km diameter from the portal. The home reality protects itself by throwing up a magical barrier that lets things into the beachhead but not out.

### Palsy

Resist (Resilience)

If the caster is able to overcome their Target with this spell, they can turn the victim's own nervous system against them. The spell will paralyse the target, provided the spell's magnitude is greater than quarter of the target's current hit points.

### Poison Antidote

This spell counteracts an antidote to any poison. For the duration of the spell, it reduces any poison's potency by its magnitude X 5. This is for the chance to resist the poison initially. If that resistance test is failed, it still reduces the poison's effective potency by its magnitude X 5. If cast on a person who is already affected by a poison, they get another chance to resist the poison.

### Protective Sphere

When completed, the Protective Sphere will create a sphere-shaped area of protection with a radius in metres equal to the spell's magnitude. If this spell is cast on the ground (or another immovable place), it cannot be moved. If cast on a vehicle (such as the bed of a wagon) or a person, it will move with the target. After the sphere has been completed any one or all of the following spells can be added to provide the defensive capacities of the Sphere during the duration of the Sphere. The Sphere on its own provides no protection, that is down to the Resistance spells.

Damage Resistance, Spell Resistance, Spirit Resistance.

The Protective Sphere's perimeter contains the benefits of its combined Resistance spell(s). The Protective Sphere only inhibits spells or attacks entering the circle from the outside – attacks or spells originating within the circle are unaffected. Thus, a Protective Sphere against spirits would block out outside spirits but have no effect on those already inside its perimeter. A Protective Sphere against damage or spells would block out incoming attacks/spells but have no effect on attacks made within the sphere (including attacks targeting those outside the sphere).

### Remove Disease

This spell purges the recipient of any disease that is currently afflicting them. Make an opposed roll of the spell's magnitude vs. the disease's potency. If successful the character is restored to full health, any penalties to characteristics are removed and any hit points lost to the effects of the disease are regained.

### (Sense) Projection

Concentration

Each (Sense) Projection spell is a separate spell. These spells encompass the five base senses, but there are also variants for any unusual sensory mechanisms appropriate to the game world (such as sonar).

This spell allows the caster to project one of their senses anywhere within the spell's range. The spell forms an invisible and intangible sensor, some ten centimetres across, which receives the specified type of sensory input and transmits it to the caster. The sensor can move metres per combat round equal to the spell's magnitude, directed by the sorcerer, and allows the sorcerer to use their Perception skill through the sensor.

Spells can be cast through the sensor of some Projection spells. For instance, ranged spells require Sight Projection, while touch spells require Touch Projection (and likely Sight Projection too, so the Sorcerer can find their target efficiently).

Characters using Mystic Vision can see the sensor and attack it if they wish, though it is only vulnerable to magic. Magical weapons and spells employed against the sensor will not destroy it but will instead transfer their damage directly to the caster.

### Sense (Substance)

Concentration

Eminently useful for finding valuables from afar, this spell has a variation for every substance imaginable. Sense (Substance) will cause all sources of the substance within range of the spell to glow an appropriate colour, visible only to the caster – diamonds will gleam like ice, amber will shine like a camp-fire and so on. Each point of this spell's magnitude allows it to penetrate one metre of rock, wood or dirt. If the source is concealed behind such a material, the surface nearest the caster will glow for a moment. The spell cannot penetrate refined metal, though it can penetrate ore.

### Shapechange (Species) to (Species)

Resist (Resilience), Touch

Each Shapechange spell is a separate spell. Of all the spells with multiple variations, the Shapechange spell has the most, comprising a new spell for almost every combination of creatures imaginable. The spell only works on living things – the dead or inanimate cannot be shape changed.

The magnitude of the spell must be equal to or greater than the average SIZ of both specified species. Thus, changing a mouse (SIZ 1) into a newt (also SIZ 1) is magnitude 1. Changing a mouse into a lion (SIZ 19) is magnitude 10.

If the spell is successful, the target will be biologically changed, gaining the STR, DEX, CON and SIZ of its new form. Its INT, POW and CHA are unchanged, and the target retains its memories and abilities (though it may be unable to use some of those abilities in its new form).

### Skin of Life

Touch

This spell protects the recipient from suffocation by air deprivation, due to such factors as drowning or the Smother spell. Each point of magnitude will cover three points of SIZ – thus a magnitude 4 Skin of Life spell would sustain a SIZ 12 creature.

### Smother

Concentration, Resist (Resilience Special)

If successful, this spell neutralises the air surrounding the target, making each breath stale and worthless, depriving it of oxygen. The caster must concentrate each round, in order to keep the spell operating. For the duration of the spell, the target will be unable to breathe, essentially drowning on dry land.

When the spell begins, the target's Resilience test determines whether it is able to gasp in one last breath before Smother cuts off the surrounding oxygen supply. If the target succeeds, it may hold its breath as normal. If it fails, it will start drowning in the next combat round.

This spell can also be used to extinguish fires, as the flames will be starved of oxygen. At magnitude 1, it can extinguish a Flame, magnitude 2 a Large Flame, magnitude 4 a Small Fire, magnitude 7 a Large Fire and magnitude 10 it will put out an Inferno. Smother has no effect on magical fire or on fire-based creatures.

### Spell Resistance

This spell matches its magnitude against the magnitude of any incoming spell. If Spell Resistance's magnitude is greater than the incoming spell's, then the incoming spell has no effect. If the incoming spell's magnitude is equal to or greater than the magnitude of Spell Resistance, then the spell affects the target normally.

Unlike many protective spells, Spell Resistance remains in place for the entirety of its duration – spells that successfully breach the spell do not dispel it. However, it does not discriminate between incoming spells – a comrade attempting to magically heal the recipient of Spell Resistance must overcome it in order to successfully use a healing spell.

### Spirit Resistance

This spell matches its magnitude against the POW of any spirit that comes into contact with the recipient. If the recipient of the caster's POW the Spirit Resistance's magnitude is greater than the spirit's POW, the spirit cannot touch the recipient.

A spirit unable to touch a recipient will not be able to attack or directly harm them, including through ranged attacks. A spell cast by a spirit at the recipient is blocked unless its magnitude exceeds the Spirit Resistance's magnitude.

### Summon (Other World creature)

Resist (Persistence)

This spell allows the sorcerer to summon one Other World creature, per casting, to the mundane world. The creature is not automatically under the sorcerer's control. If the summoned creature succeeds its Persistence test, it is free of the sorcerer's command and, if so inclined, may be hostile to the sorcerer. Otherwise, it acts as if under the influence of a Dominate spell, for the duration of the spell. The duration of the summon spell also determines how long the creature is trapped in the Mundane World.

Example Other World creatures: Demons, Elementals, Spirits and Undead.

### Tap (characteristic)

Concentration, Resist (Persistence), Touch

There are actually seven Tap spells, one for each characteristic. These devastating spells allow the caster to permanently strip a target of characteristic points, transforming them into magic points for their own use.

The caster must make contact with the target, either physically or through Touch Projection, in order to Tap it – therefore the spell cannot be used on incorporeal creatures, such as spirits.

Tap will only work if its magnitude is equal to, or greater than, the target's specified characteristic. Thus, a magnitude 6 Tap Strength spell would only work on targets with a STR of 6 or lower.

The number of points Tapped by the spell is equal to 1D6 per combat round the spell is applied to the victim.

Characteristic points lost to Tap are lost permanently, though the victim can raise them again through the normal means of increasing a characteristic. Characteristics may be tapped to 0, which usually involves the death of the victim (the exception being Charisma).

For each characteristic point the sorcerer Taps, they will gain one magic point. The sorcerer is limited in the number of magic points they can gain through Tap; the spell can only increase their magic points to double their normal limit. A sorcerer may simply Tap a target and dissipate any gained magic points.

If the sorcerer gains more magic points through Tap than their normal maximum, the points will disappear at the rate of one magic point per minute once the spell finishes.

### Teleport

Instant, Resist (Dodge)

Teleport allows a sorcerer to move their self or a target, instantaneously, to anywhere within the range of the spell, as long as the destination can be directly observed (Sense Projection spells allow the Caster to 'see' locations beyond the physical line of sight), there is solid footing, and no objects bar their arrival. If these conditions are not met, the spell automatically fails. The caster is able to teleport objects up to 3 points of SIZ per point of magnitude.

### Time Travel (Time Period)

Instant

This spell transports the caster and creatures (of SIZ 12-18) equal to the magnitude of the spell to a named time era via a time tunnel that opens up and instantly sucks them through to their destination. The duration of the spell is the time that the caster and group jump forward or backwards through time.

Sorcerers usually have some knowledge about the time period they are travelling to and use an Anchor, a landmark such as a bronze statue, that exists in both the original and destination time period. If they are travelling blind without such an Anchor, the casting roll is at -25%, and the effects of a fumbled roll are even more catastrophic than the examples below suggest.

If the spell casting is failed, the caster and group still travel, but they end up in the wrong location (1D10 Km away from the anchor point) and time (1D10 time units away, the length of the time unit depends on duration, e.g. if the duration was in days, the time unit is days).

If the spell casting is fumbled, catastrophic events occur. Here are some example events, the creative Referee is encouraged to create more:

A guardian creature from the Other World emerges through the portal and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close the portal.

The sorcerer, and all within 10m of them, is sucked through the portal which then promptly closes. The sorcerer is so befuddled that they cannot remember the spell for D20+D4 hours.

As above, but the sorcerer and party arrive in a completely different Time Era or even an Alternative Reality.

Sorcerers with this spell can "change" time freely without having to worry about unintentional "butterfly effect" changes or any alterations in their own existence or memory from changing "their" past. However, regular use risks the catastrophic effects of a fumble.

### Treat Wounds

Instant, Touch

This spell must be cast upon a wounded character. It dramatically accelerates the natural healing rate of the target. For every point of magnitude of this spell the caster can repair one hit point per combat round, for the duration of the spell.

The spell cast at magnitude 6 instantly heals mortal wounds, bringing the character's hit point total to one.

This spell does not treat disease or poison. See Remove Disease and Poison Antidote, respectively.

### Venom

Resist (Resilience Special), Touch

This spell infuses the target's body with a magical poison. The potency of the poison is equal to the spell's magnitude x 5, takes effect instantly, and does damage equal to the magnitude per combat round for the spell's duration. The target may resist the poison with a Resilience test.
