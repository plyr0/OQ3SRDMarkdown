# OQ3 SRD Personal Magic

## Magic Points

All characters start play with magic points equal to their POW characteristic score. A character's POW score also acts as a maximum limit to the number of magic points a character can store at any one time.

Magicians can have access to additional pools of magic points, via bound magic spirits (see Call Spirit) and magic items that act as magic point stores (see Create Magic Point Store). However, these pools regenerate, if at all, independently of the character's natural rate (see below). Experienced Personal Magic users will have several magic point stores and bound magic spirits at their disposal, which allows them to cast many of their spells without using their precious pool of magic points.

A magician whose magic points fall to zero falls unconscious until they have regained one magic point.

### Regaining Magic Points

Using magic points is a draining and exhausting activity that requires a significant effort from which the body needs to recover. Magic points regenerate once the character entirely rests, either by sitting down and taking it extremely easy or by having a good night's sleep.

For every two hours that a character rests, they regain magic points equal to a quarter of their total POW.

If the character has a comfortable uninterrupted sleep of eight hours, they will regain their full magic points.

Characters may never exceed their original magic point total by resting.

## Learning Personal Magic Casting

Personal Magic Casting is a skill. The base percentage is POW X 3. The Personal Magic Casting skill determines the success for casting all Personal Magic spells. Under the default rules, during character generation all player characters gain Personal Magic Casting skill at the base level and 6 points of magnitude of spells.

## Learning Personal Magic Spells

Characters can learn Personal Magic spells from other characters who know the spell. If the spell has a variable magnitude, the teacher must know it at the magnitude that the character wants to learn it or higher. It costs one growth point per magnitude point to learn a Personal Magic spell. If a character knows a spell at a lower magnitude, they only have to pay the difference in growth points to gain the spell at a higher magnitude.

Of all the approaches, Personal Magic is the least powerful, but it is the easiest to obtain.

 Several sources teach Personal Magic.

- _From local folklore and tradition._ Families hand down spells, and the local Wise can teach healing spells and so on to good members of the community.
- _From remote hermits and otherworldly Shamans,_ who commune with the Spirit World and learn its secrets.
- _From local priests._ Who teach Personal Magic associated with their gods' mythological exploits.

In each case, the player character must be in good standing with the teacher before they teach them the spell. If the teacher is indifferent to the player character to start with, then they will first need to undertake some kind of service, which can be the focus of an adventure.

## Casting Spells

A character must be able to move their hands to make gestures and be able to chant to cast a spell and must be able to see their target.

When the character is casting a spell under duress, such as during combat, they must pass a Personal Magic Casting test to cast the spell successfully. In this regard, Personal Magic is like any other skill. If the character is relaxed and has all the time in the world, then no casting test is needed, the spell is automatically cast.

If the Personal Magic Casting test succeeds, the caster spends magic points equal to the magnitude of the spell. The spell then takes effect.

If the Personal Magic Casting test fails, the spell does not take effect, and the character loses one magic point.

### Critical Success

A critical success on a Personal Magic Casting test means that the caster has been able to control the flow of the magic particularly effectively. The character loses one magic point instead of the normal cost of the spell.

### Fumble

A fumble on a Personal Magic Casting test means that the caster has been unable to control the flow of the Personal Magic. Rather than losing a single magic point for failing to cast the spell, the caster loses the full cost of the spell, as if they had cast it successfully.

## Casting Time

Casting a spell is an action that requires full concentration, though the character may slowly walk up to half their movement during spell casting.

All spells take one combat round to cast.

Casting begins at the start of the combat round, and a spell's effect happens on the caster's Personal Magic Casting Skill.

Distractions, or attacks on the caster as they cast, will automatically ruin the spell, unless the caster successfully passes a Persistence test, thereby maintaining concentration on the spell. Examples of distraction include blinding, disarming, or wounding the caster.

## Limits to Personal Magic

### Maximum Known Spells

A character has a limit of their POW in magnitude in spells. So, for example, a character with a POW of 10 could learn Babel (which has a fixed magnitude of 2), Coordination 3 Disruption 3 and Heal 2, which is a total of ten points of magnitude.

Wises have double this limit, i.e. POW x 2, due to their affinity with this type of magic.

### Limits to Variable Magic

Some Personal Magic spells are variable, which means that they can have a magnitude of anywhere from one to a maximum value of six.

The specialist caster, the Wise, because of their greater understanding of Personal Magic ignore this limit.

## Dismissing Spells

In a single combat round, a caster can dismiss any permanent spell(s) they have cast, as a free action. Ceasing to cast a spell being concentrated on is immediate and not an action.

## Spell Traits

Unless otherwise stated, all Personal Magic spells have the following traits.

- They have a variable magnitude, which means that the magnitude of the spell starts from the stated magnitude and then can be cast at a higher magnitude, if the caster knows it, giving an increase in the effect of the spell.
- Base magnitude is one.
- The range is equal to the caster's POWx3 in metres.
- All spells, unless noted, have a duration of ten minutes.

Other traits used by spells are detailed below.

_Area (X):_ The spell affects all targets within a radius specified in metres.

_Concentration:_ The spell's effects will remain in place so long as the character continues to concentrate on it. Concentrating on a spell is functionally identical to casting the spell, requiring the caster to continue to chant and ignore distractions.

_Instant:_ The spell's effects take place instantly. The spell itself then disappears.

_Magnitude (X):_ The strength and power of the spell. Also, the minimum number of magic points required to cast it.

_Non-Variable:_ The spell has a fixed magnitude.

_Permanent:_ The spell's effects remain in place until they are dispelled or dismissed.

_Resist (Dodge/Persistence/Resilience):_ The spell's intended effects do not succeed automatically. The target may make a Dodge, Persistence or Resilience test (as specified by the spell) to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Dodge) spells require the target to be able to use the Dodge reaction and are subject to the usual cumulative -20% modifier for taking previous reactions already in that combat round. In the case of spells with an area effect, the Resist (Dodge) trait needs the target to dive to avoid the spell's effect.

_Touch:_ These spells require the character to touch their target for the spell to take effect, using an Unarmed skill test to make contact. The caster must remain in physical contact with the target for the entire casting.

## Spell Descriptions

### Animal Whisperer

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Touch

The caster whispers into the ear of a distressed animal, calming it. If the distressed animal is under the influence of a spell such as Fear (see Divine Magic) or Scare (see below), then it gets another Persistence test to shake off the effect of the spell.

### Babel

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

If the target fails their Persistence roll, this spell garbles the language of the affected creature. The target can still think and, for the most part, act normally, but anything it says comes out as gibberish. Thus, a commanding officer would be unable to give orders to their men, and a spell caster would be unable to cast spells.

### Back Eyes

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

This spell grants the recipient awareness as if they had physically got eyes in the back of their head for the duration of the spell, which allows them to make Perception rolls and be aware of others behind them.

### Beast Call

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Instant, Resist (Resilience)

The Beast Call serves to attract an animal within range. When the spell is cast, it affects a targeted creature with a fixed INT of 7 or less. If it fails to resist, the creature will go to the place where the caster stands, and the spell effect terminates. Any barrier, immediate threat, or counter control, also end the effects of the spell, leaving the creature to react naturally.

_For example_, the Beast Call spell might cause a horse to turn and walk towards the spell, but a single yank of its reins by the rider would end the spell's effect.

This spell is a potent aid to hunters and herders.

### Befuddle

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

This spell confuses and clouds the mind of its target if they fail a Persistence roll. The affected target may not cast spells and may only take non-offensive actions. The target may run if it so chooses and may dodge and normally parry in combat. Any skills that have INT as a base are at -20% when tested while the target is under the effects of this spell.

This spell is effective against humanoids and natural creatures. Other creatures (such as spirits or magical beasts like dragons) are not affected by this spell.

### Block Sense (Sense)

Magnitude 3, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

Depending on the version of this spell it will Blind/Deafen/Desensitise taste or smell/Numb touch on a failed resistance roll for the duration of the spell.

### Call Spirit (Type)

Magnitude 3, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

This spell summons a single spirit of a given type from the Spirit World to do the bidding of the caster. The spirit resists the call by using its Persistence. If it succeeds, it can return to the Spirit World. Unless combined with a Binding attempt (see below), the spirit that fails a Persistence roll must perform one action, within its power, for the caster, after which it returns to the Spirit World.

_Types of Spirits_

- Disease spirits inflict disease upon the possessed victim.
- Passion (Fear/Madness/Pain) these spirits work upon the passions of a victim and cause mental debilitation and distress.
- Healing spirits heal wounds and drive out possessing disease spirits.
- Magic spirits know spells and have magic points that the caller may use.
- For more information about Spirits, see the Creatures chapter.

#### Binding Spirits

If the character wants to bind a spirit, they must engage in spiritual combat. If they win, they can bind the spirit to an item or their person, by spending an additional growth point. If they fail, the spirit either flees to the Spirit World if it is a Magic or Healing spirit or possesses the caster if it is a Disease or Passion spirit.

### Care

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Touch

This spell places the recipient under the care of the caster. If the caster has any active Protection or Countermagic spells, the character under the effects of the Care spell also benefits from the effects of these spells.

### Clear Path

Touch

This spell allows the caster to move through even the most tangled, thorny brush as if they were on an open road. For each additional point of magnitude, an additional person can accompany them.

### Coordination

Touch

For every point of magnitude.

+10% added to the target's combat order.

+10% to Dodge or DEX based Athletics tests.

### Countermagic

Instant

This spell is cast in advance and sits dormant until a hostile spell attacks the recipient. At this point, the Countermagic spell fires off. As long as Countermagic's magnitude equals or exceeds the target spell's magnitude, the target spell does not take effect. After the Countermagic tries to block a spell, successfully or not, it ends.

### Cover Blind Side

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable

For the duration of the spell, the target can react to attacks from behind or flank attacks as if they were a normal attack from the front. It does not confer any additional reactions.

### Create Charms

Permanent

A charm is a physical item that stores one or more Personal Magic spells. A charm could be a necklace that holds a Befuddle 4 spell; a sword etched with runes that holds a Weapon Enhance 2 spell; or even a sheet of paper with a poem written on it that, when held against the skin, provides a Protection 1 spell.

To create a charm a character must possess both the spell they wish to store and Create Charm at the same or greater magnitude.

The item which going to hold the charm within close range of the caster for the length of the casting.

If the caster spends one growth point at the time of creation, the spell within the charm is reusable. Otherwise once the spell is cast the charm is dispelled.

A spell stored in a charm uses the wielder's Personal Magic Casting skill and the wielder's magic points.

The time taken to create a single-use charm is one hour per point of the magnitude of the spell; Reusable charms take three hours per point of magnitude to create.

Charms are mundane items. Breaking the item dispels the charm.

### Create Magic Point Store

Permanent

This spell allows the caster to create an item which has magic point storing capabilities. Magic Point Stores allow the owner to have a pool of magic points in addition to their own.

Typically, crystals, due to their physical toughness, make good stores. This spell can also be combined with an existing charm, such as a sword with Weapon Enhance 2 stored in it, to provide a pool of magic points to cast the spell from. In-game terms treat anything enchanted with this spell as unbreakable.

Magic point stores take one hour per magic point stored in them to create.

The caster must fill the item with their magic points as part of the spell. The number of magic points put into the item at the time of casting becomes the maximum.

By default, when used, the stored magic points do not regenerate and when all used up the spell ends. If the caster spends one growth point while creating the store, it is reusable, and the caster can refill the store using their magic points.

If the item containing the store becomes damaged or destroyed, the magic points are released harmlessly into the surrounding area.

### Create Potion

Permanent

Potions are liquids that store one or more Personal Magic spells. The magnitude of the Create Potion spell needs to equal or exceed the total of the magnitude of the spells placed into the potion.

All potions are one use. They must be drunk in one swift gulp to work.

The potion automatically works and doesn't incur a cost in magic points to the person who is drinking it.

If multiple spells are placed in the potion, they are all cast on the drinker when the potion is drunk.

Drinking the potion takes place on the drinker's Athletics skill, if the timing is important such as when determining combat order.

The potion costs the enchanter magic points. They must know the spell at the magnitude enchanting at, with the magic points of the spell(s) placed into the potion.

There is an associated cost of 1 Gold Ducat per magnitude in materials, which includes the flask that contains the potion.

Potions take one hour per point of the magnitude of the spell(s) stored to create.

An airtight container must be used to store a potion, or it evaporates, losing one point of magnitude per week.

### Create Scroll

Permanent

This spell allows the caster to create a written version of the spell for use later. Either to impart knowledge of the spell to a trainee or as a reference when casting the spell in the field.

The caster must be able to read and write in some form of written language, which is represented by having a Language skill of over 80%. They must also pay for the special inks and scroll paper (1 Gold Ducat per point of magnitude).

The trainee must be able to read the language that the scroll uses. Once every three months they may study the scroll, which takes one day per point of spell, and then make a Language skill test. If successful, they spend the normal growth cost to learn the spell. If they roll a critical they half that cost, to the nearest whole unit. If they fumble, they can never learn the spell from that scroll, it is beyond their understanding.

To directly cast a spell from the scroll, the caster must be able to read the language the scroll uses. Then cast the spell as normal. Casting is much slower than if the caster is casting the spell from memory. First, the caster reads the spell out loud and then harnesses and shapes the magical energies. Therefore, no matter what their normal casting skill, the spell takes an entire combat round to cast, and fires off at the end of the combat round.

In both cases, once learnt or cast, unless the original writer spends one growth point at the time of creation to make the scroll reusable, the ink fades, and the scroll crumbles to dust.

### Cushion Fall

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

The successful casting of this spell eliminates all falling damage for the recipient for the duration of the spell.

### Darkwall

Area 5m, Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

Light sources within a Darkwall area shed no light, and normal sight ceases to function. Other senses such as a bat's sonar and night vision (see chapter 11 Creatures) function normally.

The caster may move the Darkwall 15 metres per combat round if they concentrate on the spell.

### Demoralise

Magnitude 2, Resist (Persistence), Non-Variable

This spell creates doubt and uncertainty into the very heart and soul of the target. The target of this spell has all combat skills halved and may not cast offensive spells. If this spell takes effect before combat begins, the target will try to avoid fighting and will either run or surrender. The Fanaticism spell automatically cancels the effects of this spell, and vice versa.

### Detect (Type)

Magnitude 1, Concentration, Non-Variable

This description covers a family of spells that all operate similarly, allowing the caster to locate the closest target of the spell within its range. Any Detect spell is stopped by a thick substance, such as metal, earth or stone, at least one metre thick. It is also blocked by Countermagic, though the caster will know the target is somewhere within range (though not its precise location) and that Countermagic is protecting it. The separate Detect spells are listed below, and each must be learned separately.

_Detect Enemy:_ Gives the location of the nearest creatures that intend to harm the caster.

_Detect Magic:_ Gives the location of the nearest magic item, magical creature or active spell.

_Detect Species:_ Each Detect Species spell will give the location of the nearest creature of the specified species. Examples of this spell include Detect Goblin, Detect Rhino and Detect Elf.

_Detect Substance:_ Each Detect Substance spell will give the location of the nearest substance of the specified type. Examples of this spell include Detect Coal, Detect Gold and Detect Wood.

### Dispel Magic

Instant

This spell will attack and eliminate other spells. Dispel Magic will eliminate a combined magnitude of spells equal to its magnitude, starting with the most powerful affecting the target. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell's magnitude is too high), then its effects immediately end. Dispel Magic cannot partially dispel spells, so a target under the effects of a spell whose magnitude is higher than that of Dispel Magic will not have any spells currently affecting it eliminated.

### Disruption

Instant, Resist (Resilience)

Disruption pulls a target's body apart. On a failed Resilience skill test, the target will suffer 1D4 points of damage per point of magnitude, ignoring any armour points.

### Drive Out Spirit

Instant, Resist (Persistence), Variable

This spell excommunicates a spirit that is either covertly or dominantly, possessing a character or physical location. The spirit resists eviction from its host using its Persistence, with a penalty of -10% for every magnitude point of the spell. If the spirit fails the test, it goes back to the Spirit World.

### Dull Weapon

This spell works on any weapon. For every point of magnitude, it reduces the damage dealt by the target weapon by two points. This spell does not affect the damage inflicted by the damage bonus of the user.

### Enhance (Skill)

Like Detect (Type), this includes several different spells, each of which affects a different non-combat skill. For each point of magnitude, the recipient gains +10% to any skill test using the Enhanced skill. Alternatively, for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the caster can affect one more target. How the caster allocates this magnitude between bonuses and targets is up to the caster, providing each bonus are in multiples of 10%, and the total of bonuses equals the spells magnitude x 10%.

_For example_, Ethelred may have Enhance (Deception) 5. He could cast it all on himself to give a whopping +50% to their Deception or could cast it on himself and an ally, giving himself +30% and their ally +20%. If in a larger group, he could even cast it on 5 allies, each of whom would gain +10% to their Deception skill.

The most common spells of this type are:

_Enhance (Deception)_, often used by thieves.

_Enhance (Trade)_, used by merchants.

_Enhance (Influence)_, used by lawyers, con-artists and officers.

_Enhance (Resilience)_, used by warriors.

_Enhance (Persistence)_, used by magicians.

### Extinguish

Instant

This spell instantly puts out fires. At magnitude 1 it can extinguish a flame, magnitude 2 a small fire, magnitude 3 a large fire and magnitude 4 will put out an inferno.

### Fanaticism

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable

The target of this spell will have close combat and unarmed combat skills increased by +20% but may not attempt to cast spells. Also, for the duration of the spell, the target has a +50% bonus to any Persistence test. The Demoralise spell and vice versa automatically cancel the effects of this spell.

### Farsight

Concentration

Each point of this spell extends the caster's field of vision by twenty metres as long as they maintain their concentration. Although they can see small details at a distance, this spell does not let the caster see through walls or other obstructions.

### Firearrow

Magnitude 2, Touch, Non-Variable

Casting this spell on a missile weapon will allow it to fire magical missiles of flame. When one of these missiles hits a target, it deals 1D10 points of magical fire damage. Since the Firearrow does magical damage, it affects creatures that are immune to normal damage. A target remains on fire once hit, taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they spend a combat action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts Extinguish on them. A missile weapon under the effects of Firearrow cannot benefit from Multimissile or Speedart

### Fireblade

Magnitude 4, Touch, Non-Variable

For the duration of the spell, the target weapon deals an additional 1D10 magical fire damage as well as its normal damage. One struck by the weapon remains on fire, taking 1D10 damage per round in subsequent rounds, until they spend a combat action putting out the flames or someone successfully casts Extinguish on them. A weapon under the effects of Fireblade cannot benefit from Weapon Enhance. Since Fireblade does magical damage, it damages creatures immune to normal damage."

### Fist of Gold

This spell creates a minor illusion of 1D10 Gold Ducats per level of magnitude that persists for the duration of the spell.

### Fist of the Wind

Instant

Each point of magnitude allows the caster to make one extra unarmed attack. These attacks happen in a blur of motion as soon as the spell fires (i.e. when the spell takes effect), instead of the normal combat order that the character's attacks happen on. An attack roll is made separately for each attack.

### Frostbite

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Instant, Resist (Resilience)

This attack spell allows the caster to freeze their opponent, dealing 1D8 points of damage, ignoring any armour points. Magical protection that protects against cold damage can block this effect, but mundane items (such as severe weather gear) are ineffective.

### Glue

Touch, Area

This spell covers an area of one centimetre square for each magnitude with extremely sticky glue. If a creature steps on the glue, it must make an Athletics roll vs. the magnitude x 10% to avoid being stuck for one round. On subsequent rounds, it must make the same roll to break free. This spell can also make conventional repairs, for example repairing a broken sword, with magnitude x 10% being the chance that the item won't break again if used in circumstances that would cause it to.

### Harden

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Touch

This spell makes a target item unbreakable for the duration of the spell. Therefore, weapons with this spell cast on them will not break when a fumble occurs in combat, and it allows items that are normally too brittle to be wielded in combat to be used as improvised weapons.

### Heal

Instant, Touch

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the caster can repair one hit point to damage to either themselves or another target.

_Mortal Wounds_. A magnitude 6 or higher Heal spell will heal a mortal wound (any damage that takes the character to zero hit point or less) instantly, restoring them to one hit point.

_Curing Disease or Poison._ At magnitude 5 or higher , a Heal spell will also cure any single poison or disease affecting the target. Lost hit points are restored normally, but any other damage caused by the poison or disease, such as characteristic loss, will not be restored.

This spell can not be used to bring characters who are dead back to life.

### Hinder (Skill)

Ranged, Resist (Persistence)

Like Enhance (Skill), this is several different spells, each of which affects a different skill. For each point of the magnitude of the spell, the target gains a -10% penalty to the next skill test using the affected skill.

Alternatively, for each additional point of magnitude of the spell, the caster can affect one more target. The bonuses and targets are allocated as necessary, provided each penalty is in multiples of 10%, and the total of bonuses equals the spell's magnitude x 10%. If used in this way, each target is affected separately; if one target succeeds in resisting the spell, other targets may fail and be affected.

The most common spells of this type are as follows.

- _Hinder (Perception)_, often used by thieves.
- _Hinder (Trade)_, used by the nastier traders.
- _Hinder (Persistence),_ used by magicians against enemy spellcasters before casting spells upon them.

### Ignite

Instant, Magnitude 1, Non-Variable

Ignite will set fire to anything flammable within range, creating a flame. If the target is attached to a living being (such as hair, fur or clothes), then the spell gains the Resist (Resilience) trait. Damage is dependent on the size of the Target (see page 86) but for a typical human-sized creature is 1D6 per round.

### Ironmind

Magnitude 3, Non-variable.

This spell hardens the resolve of the recipient for its duration. The spell adds 20 % to all Persistence tests against magical attacks to the mind (e.g. Fear, Befuddle, etc.) or opposed tests vs. Influence.

### Leap

Touch, Resist (Dodge)

This spell causes the target to leap 2m up in the air for each point of magnitude. If cast upon an unwilling target, make a resistance roll and roll for falling damage on failure.

### Levitating Disc

Concentration, Area 1 per Magnitude

This spell creates an invisible disc, 1m in diameter for each point of magnitude. It can carry weight equivalent to one person and their belongings per point of magnitude and moves at twice the magnitude in metres per combat round.

_For example_, a Levitating Disc with magnitude 3 can carry 3 people, is 3m in diameter, and moves at a rate of 6m per combat round.

### Light

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Area 10

When cast on a physical object (including living material), this spell causes the object to shed light across the area of effect. The spell illuminates only the specified area – everything outside the area of effect is not lit. This spell creates raw light, not a flame.

### Lock

Touch, Permanent

This spell gives an item a resistance to being opened equal to the spell's magnitude x 10%. The item must have a lock, such as might be found on a door or a chest, as a focus for the spell. Once the lock has been forced/picked, the spell ends.

### Mindspeech

This spell can affect one target for every point of magnitude. It allows telepathy between the caster and any target, though targets will not have telepathy with one another. The words transmitted by telepathy must be whispered and will be heard directly in the head of the recipient, in the same language in which the caster spoke it.

### Mobility

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the target's movement rate increases by an additional two meters.

### Multimissile

Touch

If the caster succeeds in casting the spell, a missile weapon holds the spell for ten minutes. A missile under the effects of Multimissile cannot benefit from Firearrow or Speedart.

When the Multimissile-enchanted missile is fired or thrown, one additional magical missile fires for every point of magnitude. Each magic missile's attack is separate, and each does the same damage as the original (though they will not benefit from the character's damage modifier). Magical missiles created through Multimissile will not cause critical hits, though the original missile can. Magical missiles created through Multimissile will affect creatures that can only be hurt by magic.

### Personal Insight

Magnitude 2 Non-Variable

This spell gives the caster or recipient a straightforward insight into a small question directly relevant to them, in the form of an internal intuition.

_For example_ the question "Why can I not harm the creature?" would get the answer "Because your sword is not enchanted", while "Why can we not harm the creature?" would not get an answer.

### Pierce

Touch

This spell affects any weapon with a blade or point. For every point of magnitude, it ignores one armour point when it strikes armour. Pierce can bypass magical armour as easily as normal armour.

### Protection

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the armour of the target gains one additional armour point.

### Push/Pull

Instant, Resist (Resilience)

This spell allows the caster to move an item of up to 3 SIZ or ENC per point of magnitude either towards or away from them in a straight line as if pushed suddenly from one direction or the other. The item does not move with significant enough force to inflict damage unless it is naturally damaging (a bottle of acid, for instance). The caster has no control over the distance pushed or pulled, as this depends on the location of the item and/or the surface on which it rests. Living creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a Resilience roll to resist.

### Read Emotion

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Instant, Resist (Persistence)

This spell, when cast, tells you what the true emotional state of the target is if they fail a Persistence roll.

### Resist (Element)

This spell increases resistance against hostile effects, magic or otherwise, from a given element (Air/Darkness/Earth/Fire/Water) by 10% per point of magnitude and subtracts 2 points of damage from that element per point of magnitude.

### Restore Energy

Instant, Touch

Each point of this spell's magnitude instantly removes one fatigue level from the recipient.

### Sap Energy

Instant, Touch, Resist (Resilience)

Each point of this spell's magnitude adds one fatigue level from the target upon a failed Resilience roll.

### Scare

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Resist (Persistence)

On a failed resistance roll, the target is scared for 1D6 rounds. Scared targets must withdraw from combat with the caster for the duration of the spell, and move as quickly as they are able, directly away from the caster.

### Second Sight

Magnitude 3, Non-Variable

Second Sight allows the caster to gauge the POW of every creature and magic item within the range. Anything that prevents normal vision stops the spell. The caster will know if each aura created by the illuminated POW is less than their POW, within three points of their POW, or greater than their POW.

Additionally, Second Sight provides a +20% bonus on Perception tests to notice hidden magical items or hiding people or creatures. Second Sight will also reveal invisible entities, though only a hazy image will show (treat such targets as partially obscured).

### Slip

Magnitude 1, Non-Variable, Resist (Dodge)

The caster makes the ground under the target's feet as slippery as black sheet ice. The target must make a Dodge roll or fall over prone.

### Slow

Resist (Resilience)

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, decrease target's movement rate by 2m. A target's movement may not go below one metre through use of this spell.

### Speedart

Magnitude 2, Non-Variable, Touch.

This spell is cast on a missile weapon and triggers when fired. It gives a +20% to Ranged Combat and +3 damage while using the weapon. A missile weapon under the effects of Speedart cannot benefit from Firearrow or Multimissile.

### Spirit Shield

This spell forms a magical barrier that protects the caster from magic point loss as the result of a successful attack during spirit combat. Each point of magnitude reduces the damage done by an attacking spirit by one point.

### Strength

Touch

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the target's damage increases by +1 and strength-based athletics tests are +10% per magnitude. Note, the increased damage is not magical damage.

### Talk to Animal

Magnitude 3 Non-Variable

With this spell, the recipient can talk to any beast within ten metres of them. This communication is verbal; therefore, the recipient must be able to speak and be heard by the target animal.

### Tongues

Magnitude 2 Non-Variable

This spell allows the recipient to speak another language perfectly for its duration.

### Truth Seeker

Instant

This spell grants the caster a +10% bonus per point of magnitude to their next skill test they make to discover lies, secrets or hidden objects. It does not stack with any other spell-effect bonuses.

### Unlock

Touch, Instant

This spell has a chance of opening a lock equal to the spell's magnitude x 20%, minus any modifiers due to the intricacy of the lock. If cast on a lock that has had a Lock spell cast on it, the test is an opposed test vs. the magnitude x 20% of the Lock spell.

### Vigour

Touch

For every point of the magnitude of this spell, the target's hit points increase by +2. A target cannot have its hit points increased in this way to more than twice its original score. Damage is taken from the 'magical' hit points first, so when the spell dissipates the inflicted damage taken on the magical hit points disappears too

### Vomit

Ranged, Resist (Resilience)

This spell disables its victim for 1 round per point of magnitude, due to uncontrollable vomiting. On a fumbled Resilience roll, the victim also takes 1D6 hit points damage.

### Walk on (Element)

Magnitude 3

This spell allows the recipient to walk on the specified element (Air/Darkness/Earth/Fire/Water) without sinking or taking any harm for the spell's duration. With this spell for the appropriate element, the caster can walk across lava, quicksand, water, or even through the air. Each additional point of magnitude increases the duration of the spell by 1 minute.

### Water Breath

Touch

This spell allows the target to breathe water for the duration of the spell. For every point of magnitude, one additional person can breathe water, or the duration is increased by one minute. Water Breath does not affect the target's ability to breathe air.

### Weapon Enhance

Touch

Cast this spell on any close combat weapon or any unarmed attack. For every point of magnitude, it increases the chance to hit with the weapon by +10% and deals one point of extra damage. This extra damage is magical and will affect creatures that can only be hurt by magic. The weapon's base damage remains non-magical. A weapon under the effects of this spell cannot benefit from Fireblade.

## Shamanism

### Becoming a Shaman

In game terms, a character must have a POW of at least 14 and a Personal Magic Casting skill of at least 50%. They then spend five Growth points and gain the skills of Shamanism at the base skill ranking. Becoming a Shaman is a big commitment and is usually not taken by characters during character generation unless the Referee allows it.

#### Shamanism (INT+POW)

This skill provides several spiritual abilities. These abilities, although magical in origin, are always on or, in the case of Disassociate from Body, can be instantly called on. No magic point spend is needed.

_Disassociate from Body._ The Shaman can put their body into a deep sleep, while their spirit travels the Spirit World. A slender silver cord connects the two. If the physical body suffers death, their spirit becomes trapped in the Spirit World. While in the Spirit World, if the Shaman reaches 1 or 0 magic points, their Spirit returns to their body immediately. In this 'dissociated' form, the Shaman can engage in Spirit Combat with an attack equal to their Shamanism score. During their time in the Spirit World, the Shaman has no physical body, therefore is considered STR, CON, DEX and SIZless. They cannot use any skills that are based upon those Characteristics or require a physical presence. The only way that a dissociated shaman can interact with the physical world is through casting spells or spiritually attacking. While disassociated, the Shaman is invisible to the physical world.

_See into the Spirit World._ The Shaman can always see what is happening in the Spirit World and therefore detect spirits that are invisible to non-Shamans.

_Assess the Harmony of the Spirit World._ This ability allows the Shaman to sense if something is wrong with the immediate Spirit World to a range of POW in kilometers.

_Spirit World Knowledge._ The Shaman learns about the geography of the Spirit World and the cultures of its inhabitants.

Able to Initiate Spirit Combat_._ Unlike untrained characters, Shamans can engage spirits in Spirit Combat, without having to cast any extra magic spells. See the Spirit Combat section, under Magical Combat, in the Combat chapter for more details.

#### Commonly Known Personal Magic

Shamans commonly learn the following Personal Magic spells.

Call Spirit (Type), Drive Out Spirit, and Spirit Shield.

#### Limits on Shamans

Due to their differences in views on how magic fundamentally works, Shamans may not use Sorcery. Some Divine Magic Religions may have a place for Shamanism within their practices and belief systems, for example as a form of ancestor worship, and Shamans may join such religions and learn their Divine Magic as a result.

#### Crossing over the Veil and becoming a Great Spirit

Shamans who achieve mastery of Shamanism, know how to become Great Spirits, passing over to the Spirit World. They enter a permanent state of disassociation from their body, which they only inhabit if they need to interact with mortal beings. Their body goes into suspended animation. If the original body is destroyed then they simply possess another, using dominant possession.

Requirements

Shamanism at 100%.

POW at maximum (21 for humans).

Knows ten different Personal Magic spells.

Benefits

POW has no limit.

Disassociates from Body, which goes into permanent suspended animation. Can inhabit it or another body, via dominant possession.

Shamans who become Great Spirits tend to retire after a couple of Quests, as they become more concerned with affairs of the Spirit World than the mundane Real World.

## The Wise

### Becoming a Wise

In game terms, the character POW must be 14 or greater, and they must have Personal Magic Casting skill of over 50%. The character must spend five growth points. Normally, becoming a Wise during character generation is only possible if the Referee allows it since it is a big commitment for the character and something best explored in-game.

### Special Abilities

The Wise have the following special abilities.

#### Access to any Personal Magic spell

Except for those Personal Magic spells exclusive to Religions, they can learn any spell without the need of a teacher. All the Wise needs to do is go into seclusion for one day per point of magnitude they are learning and contemplate the spell that they want to learn. They then spend the usual growth point cost, and the spell is theirs.

#### Ignore Limit on Variable Magnitude

Wises go deeper into the magic than normal characters and can transcend the limit of six points of magnitude on variable spells.

#### Learn more magic spells

The Wise may learn up to POW x 2 in magnitude of spells instead of the normal POW's worth.

#### Create Magical Places

Wises can tune into the streams of magic that flow from the Magical Realm into the Real World and bring these two parallel planes close enough to one another to create magical places that they can use for their benefit.

If this is done in haste and under stress, it requires a successful Personal Magic Casting skill test. All magic places have a volume of 20 metres cubed. The descriptions below give the magic point cost to create specific types of magic place.

_Seclusion._ A hidden place in the wilderness where the Wise can learn magic undisturbed or simply just disappear. The seclusion has a connection to the Real World but technically exists in the Magical Realm. Detected by a character using Second Sight. It costs one magic point per day that it exists. For the duration of the seclusion, the Wise cannot regain the magic points that they have put into its creation. Seclusions can only be used by the Wise or another Wise that they invite into it, due to the special magical understanding that is required to believe that it exists.

_Sanctuary._ A place that gives the wise, and those accompanying them, protection against enemy magic and magical forces. It costs one magic point per hour, but companions accompanying the Wise may contribute magic points. While in the sanctuary any defensive Personal Magic spells, like Counter Magic and Protection, cast by the Wise, apply to anyone. Unlike a seclusion this has to be a real place, such as a cave or a room in a house, that the Wise then connects with the Magical World. Any magic points spent creating the sanctuary do not return until the Wise who created it ends it.

_Power._ The Wise can create a magic store tied to a physical location. The location is between one and the creator's POW metres in radius. At the time of creation, the Wise puts in an amount of Magic Points and can add to them over time. Places of Power, in theory, can store an unlimited amount of magic points. Magic detection spells, such as Second Sight and Mystic Vision, can easily find Places of Power. Other Wises can pull magic points out of the store on an opposed Personal Magic Casting skill test, where the opposing skill is the Personal Magic Casting of the Wise who set up the store originally.

All magic places can be dispelled at will or upon the death of the Wise that created them.

#### The Ability to Understand Magic

Using their Personal Magic Casting skill, the character can discern the effects of any type of magic they come across. A standard success tells them the general effects, and a critical tells them the exact nature of the magic and its source (i.e. Personal/Divine/Sorcery).

#### Commonly Known Personal Magic Spells

Wises commonly learn the following Personal Magic spells.

Countermagic, Create Charm, Create Magic Point Store, Create Scroll, Dispel Magic, Personal Insight, Second Sight.

### Limits on Wises

Wises may never learn Divine Magic or Sorcery, since these formal approaches of magic are contrary to the Wises floating and haphazard view how magic works and sever the link that the Wise has with the magical realm.

### Becoming One with Reality

Wises who reach mastery in spell casting, and have a wide variety of spells and a sanctuary magic place set up, can become one with the land that their sanctuary is in and achieve a kind of immortality.

Requirements

- POW at maximum (21 for humans).
- Personal Magic Casting at 100%.
- Must know least ten different Personal Magic Spells.
- The have created a sanctuary magic place.

Benefits

- Power has no maximum.
- If killed, returns to the sanctuary, and a new body is built from organic matter from the surrounding area over a period of 1D6 days.

Wises who become One with Reality are usually retired from play after a couple of Quests at that level. After tying up a few loose ends in their mortal lives, and defeating one last big threat to their land, they disappear into the wilderness to explore the new intimate relationship they have with their land.
