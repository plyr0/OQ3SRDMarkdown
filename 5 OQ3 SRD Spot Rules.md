# OQ3 SRD Spot Rules

This selection of rules deals with individual situations that may crop up throughout the game.

## Travel

Characters travel at their Movement Rate in kilometers daily assuming a eight hour day of travelling, so Humans travel 15 kilometers a day, while horses can travel 30 kilometers.

Characters travelling off road, through difficult terrain and conditions may at the Referee's discretion face a Natural Lore skill test, to maintain the normal movement rate. If they fail cut the daily move by half. If they fumble they face some sort of danger as determined by the Referee, a dangerous animal or a environmental hazard, or simply are lost and make no progress that day.

If you are using the Encumbrance rules characters who are overloaded, move at half that amount.

Referees may optionally make a fatigue test if the terrain or conditions were particularly taxing. For example if the characters travel along a well maintained road with places to stop and rest, with food and water, then there is no need to make a test, while at the other end of the spectrum if the characters where hiking through rough hilly terrain with no comfort breaks under a particularly harsh sun the Referee can call for a Hard (-20%) or even Impossible (-50%) fatigue test at the end of the day's travel.

If you need to determine which of two groups of comparable movement rate reached a destination first, precisely, use an opposed Athletics (for walking characters) or Riding test (for mounted characters).

## Illumination and Darkness

***Illuminating Items***

| Example | Radius |
| --- | --- |
| Candle or embers | 1 m |
| Flaming brand or lantern | 3 m |
| Campfire | 5 m |
| Bonfire | 10 m |
| Light spell | 10 m but, unlike natural light sources, the Light spell only illuminates a 10 m radius and does not provide partial darkness or darkness to areas beyond this radius. |

### Dark Sight

This ability allows the character to treat pitch-black conditions as if dark. It is normally possessed by subterranean or darkness aligned creatures.

### **Night Sight**

This ability allows the character to treat partial darkness as illuminated and darkness as only partial darkness. Nocturnal creatures normally possess this.

### Illumination and Darkness Effects

The following table gives the effects of various types of illumination and darkness on the characters.

***Illumination Effects***

| Environment is | Effects |
| --- | --- |
| Brightly Illuminated | None. |
| Illuminated | None. |
| Partial Darkness | –20% to vision-based Perception tests. |
| Dark | -50% to vision-based Perception tests. Movement Rate halved. |
| Pitch Black | Perception tests reliant on vision become near impossible, as are ranged attacks. Close combat attacks are at -50%. Movement rate a quarter of normal. |

## Fatigue

Combat, sprinting, climbing, and swimming against a strong current, are all examples of when a character can become fatigued and tired.

If the Referee rules that a character has been doing an activity that may have drained them of physical energy, then they may call for a Resilience roll. If the character fails the roll, they suffer the effects of Fatigue (see below).

This test happens after the activity is complete, unless the activity is long and drawn out, and there is a real danger that Fatigue will stop the task. For example, on a long hard march, the characters are pressing on ahead so that they can reach a fort before an enemy army arrives there. In this case, there is a real danger that they will arrive not only too late but tired and worn down.

### The Effects of Fatigue

If a character fails the Resilience test, then they become fatigued. All skill tests are at -20%. Also, movement rate drops by a quarter. The character also becomes sluggish, DEX and INT are each reduced by three points.

If the fatigued character insists on engaging in heavy activity, such as combat, heavy labour or running, then another Resilience roll is made at -20%. If the character fails this second skill test, fatigue level becomes heavily fatigued, with the above penalties increased to -50%.

If a character fumbles any of their Resilience rolls, then they immediately fall unconscious for 3D6 minutes and upon waking are still fatigued.

### Recovering from Fatigue

A character who completely rests for 20-CON hours will remove the effects of any Fatigue.

A Vigour spell (see Personal Magic) will also remove the effects of Fatigue.

### **Exposure, Starvation and Thirst**

A character can normally survive for several hours equal to their CON before suffering from exposure.

A character can survive for several days equal to their CON before becoming starved, though after three days they will begin to suffer a –20% penalty to Fatigue tests.

A character can survive for a number of hours equal to their CON x 2 before becoming chronically thirsty, though particularly arid environments may reduce this to CON x 1 or even CON x ½. Whenever a character is suffering from exposure, starvation or thirst, the Fatigue test penalty immediately changes to –20%. Also, the character will automatically suffer D6 damage every day, for every condition they are experiencing. Natural or magical healing will not heal this damage – only sufficient shelter, food or water can remedy the problem and allow natural or magical healing to take place.

## Healing

Healing can be performed in one of three ways – using the Healing skill, a magical spell, or through natural healing, resting while the injuries heal themselves.

### **Natural Healing**

A character's Minor injuries regain CON/4 (round up) hit points per 24 hours, as long as the character does not engage in anything more than light activity.

Mortal wounds do not naturally heal, see the section below for more details.

### **Magical Healing**

However magical healing is achieved, whether from a spell, prayer or potion, it has an instantaneous effect.

Unless specifically stated, magical healing cannot re-attach severed limbs or revive the dead.

### **Mortal Wounds**

Mortal wounds are those that reduce the character's hit points to zero or below.

Mortal wounds do not heal naturally on their own and require intervention from a character using the Healing skill or magical healing spells such as Heal at magnitude 6 (see Personal Magic), the Divine Magic spell Divine Heal, or the Sorcery spell Treat Wounds.

In addition to the restoration of hit points, any characters suffering a Mortal Wound that receive even a single hit point restoration through magical healing will immediately stop bleeding and will heal naturally. The character will also regain consciousness on a successful Resilience skill test.

## Encumbrance

Every piece of equipment in the Equipment chapter has an Encumbrance (ENC) score, apart from those items that are too small or light. Characters can usually ignore the effects on Encumbrance that these light items have until they start to carry a lot of them – assume that an average of 20 such items will equal 1 ENC, on the basis that the character has a suitable means of carrying them, such as a sack or backpack.

A character can carry equipment which has a total ENC of less than or equal to their STR+SIZ without penalty.

Encumbrance is a measure of not only weight but also the bulk of the item, reflecting the awkwardness of handling the item. Roughly 1 ENC is equal to 1/4 of a SIZ point.

### **Overloading**

A character carrying total ENC greater than their STR+SIZ is Overloaded.

Overloaded characters suffer a –20% penalty to all tests that require physical actions, including Weapon skill tests and most tests that have DEX or STR as a Characteristic.

Overloaded characters have their Movement halved. They also suffer a –20% penalty to all Fatigue tests.

A character cannot carry more than twice their STR+SIZ in ENC.

## Falling

A character that takes damage from a fall ends up prone. Armour points do not reduce falling damage.

A character takes 1D6 damage per metre fallen, after the first.

As long as the character was not surprised, they may attempt an Athletics test to mitigate falling damage. A successful test allows the character to treat the fall as if it were two metres shorter than it is. Also, as long as this test is a success and the character's hit points are not zero or less due to the fall, the character lands safely and is not prone. If the roll is a critical then miraculously no damage is taken. If the roll is a fumble, then the maximum possible damage is taken.

Characters falling onto soft surfaces may have the distance they fall effectively halved for damage.

## Suffocation

While underwater or moving through a poison gas cloud, a character can hold their breath for a number of Combat Rounds equal to their CON.

Once a character has surpassed the time for which they can hold their breath, they must make a Resilience test every round with a cumulative –10% penalty. On a failed roll, the character automatically starts inhaling the suffocating substance.

***Suffocating Substances***

| Substance Inhaled | Damage Taken |
| --- | --- |
| Water | 2D6 |
| Vacuum | 2D6 |
| Thick Smoke | 1D6 |
| Poison Gas | A character suffers poison exposure. If the gas is also a thick smoke, then 1D6 damage is incurred in addition to the poison's effect. |

Armour points do not reduce suffocation damage. The damage will only cease once the character can draw breathable air once more. Even then, the character will require a Resilience test to be able to do anything other than wretch or gasp for breath for 1D4 combat rounds.

## Burning

The amount of damage per combat round suffered from fire or heat will depend on its intensity, as shown on the Fire and Heat table. Metal armour, such as plate or chain mail, does not subtract from the rolled damage.

***Fire and Heat Effects***

| Source | Example | Damage/round |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flame | Candle | 1 point |
| Large Flame | Flaming brand | 1D4 |
| Small Fire | Campfire, cooking fire | 1D6 |
| Large Fire | Scolding steam, large bonfires, burning rooms | 2D6 |
| Inferno | Lava, inside a blast furnace | 3D6 |

## Poison

Plants and creatures have developed poisons as a method of protecting themselves against predators. They are also used by assassins and wrongdoers of all kinds to murder their victims.

Every type of poison has the following information detailed:

_Name:_ The poison's name. Also, if the poison is magical, it will be mentioned here.

_Type:_ Lists whether the poison is ingested, used on a weapon or inhaled.

_Delay:_ The time between the poison's introduction to a character, to the time its effect takes hold.

_Potency:_ This is a number between 10 and 100 that measures the strength of a poison. Some magical poisons, like Basilisk Venom, have even higher Potencies. A character must make an opposed Resilience test versus the poison's Potency test to avoid or mitigate the damage of the poison.

_Effect:_ Usually hit point damage, though this is not universal. Some poisons cause a character to sleep for some time. More exotic poisons may cause hallucinogenic effects, paralysis or a combination of effects. These take place after the delay noted above.

_Duration:_ How long the poison, if effective, will affect the victim. The effects of the poison cannot be removed or healed until the poison itself has been neutralised or has dissipated in the victim's system.

### Poison Succeeds, Character Fails

If the poison succeeds its Potency test, and the character fails their Resilience test, the poison has its full effect.

### Character Succeeds, Poison Fails

If the character succeeds their Resilience test and the poison fails its Potency test, the poison does not affect.

### Both Poison and Character Succeed

Whoever rolled the highest in their test wins.

### Both Poison and Character Fail

Whoever rolled the lowest in their test wins.

Here is an example of poison, that of the fearsome snake-haired Gorgon.

#### Gorgon Serpent Venom

_Type:_ Ingested or smeared

_Delay:_ 1D3 Combat Rounds

_Potency:_ 34

_Full Effect:_ 1D3 hit point damage and applies –3 penalty to victim's CON

_Duration:_ 6D10 minutes

## Disease

Disease is a source of threat in fantasy worlds, either from fantastic diseases that ravage the land from time to time or those caused by Disease Spirits.

Every type of disease has the following information detailed:

_Name:_ The disease's name. Also, if the disease is magical, it will be mentioned here.

_Type:_ Lists whether the disease is spread through contamination, touch or is airborne.

_Delay:_ The time between the disease's introduction to a character, to the time its effect takes hold. It is also the time following disease contraction that a victim will make follow-up opposed disease tests.

_Potency:_ This is a number between 10 and 100 that measures the strength of a disease. Some magical diseases, like the shining plague, have even higher Potencies. A character must make an opposed Resilience test versus the disease's Potency test to avoid or mitigate the damage of the disease.

_Effect:_ Usually hit point damage, though this is not universal. Many diseases will apply a penalty to Characteristics or skills. More exotic diseases may cause hallucinogenic effects, paralysis or a combination of effects. These take place after the delay noted above.

The effects of the disease cannot be removed or healed until the disease itself has been neutralised or has dissipated in the victim's system.

### Disease Succeeds, Character Fails

If the disease succeeds its Potency test, and the character fails their Resilience test, the disease has its full effect.

### Character Succeeds, Disease Fails

If the character succeeds their Resilience test, and the disease fails its Potency test, the disease does not affect the character.

### Both Disease and Character Succeed

Whoever rolled the highest in their test wins.

Both Disease and Character Fail

Whoever rolled the lowest in their test wins.

Unlike a poison, diseases will progress if a character does not resist its effects. Once the victim fails the first opposed test, they will have to make an additional opposed test (after an amount of time determined by the disease's delay statistic).

If the victim succeeds this second opposed test, they have overcome the worst of the disease and will no longer suffer its effects, other than remaining hit point damage, after a while. Use the disease's delay statistic to determine how long this takes.

If the victim fails this second opposed test, they fall deeper into the disease. Apply all of the disease's effects again to the character. Once the delay period has elapsed once more, the victim will have to make a third opposed disease test, and so on.

Here are two examples of diseases, one a normal mundane disease and one that is magical.

### Example Disease

_Name:_ The Shakes

_Type:_ Touch

_Delay:_ 1-2 days

_Potency:_ 50

_Effect:_ This flu-like disease renders its victims in a cold and constantly shaking state, during which DEX halved. Also, for each day that the victim suffers from the Shakes, they take 1D6 hit points of damage.

## Breaking Inanimate Objects

Sometimes a character will want to break an inanimate object, such as when a locked door needs to be forced open by breaking through the wood.

Simply make an Athletics test, since this skill covers brute force, modified by the difficulty of the task at hand. In the case of the door, there is no modification if the door is a standard door made of wood, but it becomes hard if its reinforced, and even impossible if it is made of stone. If the wood is rotten the Referee may make the roll easy or even not require a test. Some objects may not be broken, unless the character is under the effects of magic that plausibly increases their strength to the level where breaking the object is possible.

## Ships and Sailing

### Construction

There are three types of sailing ship: sloops (small, fast, but comparatively fragile one-masted vessels), brigs (fast and manoeuvrable two-masted vessels), and ships (larger vessels with at least three masts, whether warships or cargo vessels).

Weapons are handled abstractly; ship-mounted weapons are not accurate, and large numbers of shots have to be fired to have a chance to hit an enemy ship. Thus, a ship's weapons are rated abstractly as a single percentage chance to hit an enemy vessel in combat; almost certainly many weapons are fired for each "hit roll". A hit generally does 1D8 damage, subtracted from the other ship's structure points.

Every 10% in weapons reduces cargo capacity by 2 tons and means two extra crew are needed. The weapons level cannot go above 100%.

Even beyond weapons carried, not all ships are identical; any ship will have one of the following special features. It might have more than one such feature; in this case, add +50% of the original cost to the total cost per feature added.

_Armoured:_ AP 2 against any attacks.

_Fast:_ Add +1 knot to speed.

_Heavy Weapons:_ Hits from weapons do D12 rather than D8 damage.

_High Capacity:_ Increase cargo size by +50%.

_Manoeuvrable:_ Add +20% to sailing tests (see below).

_Marines:_ The ship can carry (and provide board and lodging for) marines equal to the size of its crew.

_Ram:_ The ship can ram other vessels in combat without suffering damage.

_Skeleton Crew:_ The crew size needed to run the ship (as indicated in the above table) at half strength.

***Types of Ship***

| Type of Ship | Crew | Cost (SP) | Maneuverability | Speed | Structure Points | Cargo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One-masted | 10 | 5000 | +20% | 6 Knots | 20 | 8 Tons |
| Two-masted | 20 | 15000 | - | 5 Knots | 40 | 15 Tons |
| Three-masted | 30 | 50000 | -20% | 4 Knots | 60 | 30 Tons |

### Sailing Tests

Most potential manoeuvres a vessel can make use the captain's Sailing skill, modified by the manoeuvrability of the vessel. A further modifier is the average Sailing skill level of the crew. In this case these two modifiers do add together.

***Sailing Modifiers***

| The average Sailing skill of the crew | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| 20% or less (no idea) | -20% penalty |
| 26%-50% (competent) | No modifier |
| 51%-75% (veteran) | +20% bonus |
| 76% or more (expert) | +50% bonus |

### Travel

In normal sailing conditions, a sailing vessel can move 20 miles per day per knot of speed. Speeds given are averages. Very favourable conditions – for example, a good strong wind in the desired direction of travel (possibly magically arranged) – can double these speeds. As can a rowing crew who critical their Sailing skill test.

On the other hand, if a ship is becalmed, with no wind at all, it cannot move.

Every day out of sight of land, there is a 5% chance of a storm. Storms do 2D6 structure points of damage to a ship; a ship reduced to zero structure points begins to sink (and will sink almost instantly if its structure points fall to the negative of the original amount). Further, sailors on deck must make Dodge tests to stay on board; a sailor swept overboard and not immediately rescued must make an Athletics test to survive.

Fortunately, the captain can make a Sailing test (modified by manoeuvrability) to halve damage from a storm. Better yet, it is possible to plot a course to avoid an incoming storm if it is detected in time (perhaps using magic or skills such as Natural Lore).

### Naval Combat

We consider two ranges of distance between ships. Contact or Combat Range.

#### Contact

The vessels can see each other. If both vessels wish to close to combat range or leave the contact, this action is, of course, automatic, and takes about an hour. If the vessels want different things, roll opposed Sailing tests, as above.

#### Combat Range

Combat between ships is similar to normal combat. Initiative is decided for each ship, rather than between individuals, Use the Captain's Sailing Skill, modified by the manoeuvrability of the vessel, to determine initiative for the ship.

Roll a single skill test to fire a ship's weapons with no defence roll allowed. If desired, a character can be appointed weapons officer; they oversee the firing of a ship's weapons. That character should make a Ranged Combat skill test; if the test succeeds, the ship's weapons test has a +20% bonus.

Hand-held weapons are too small to have any effect on an opposing ship. Against those on the decks they're another matter. Fire is the exception to this rule, being used to set flammable objects, such as decks and sails, on fire.

The following special manoeuvres can be made by a ship in combat range. One manoeuvre is allowed per round. Each manoeuvre needs a Sailing skill test by the captain, as indicated above.

_Broadside._ If the skill test succeeds, two attacks with a ship's weapons can be made instead of one.

_Evade._ If the Sailing test succeeds, the opponent cannot use the broadside, ram, or boarding manoeuvres. Further, the vessel can escape combat range (out to contact range) if the other vessel allows it or the Sailing test succeeds as an opposed roll.

_Ram._ The other vessel is rammed if an opposed Sailing test succeeds. A ramming attack does D6 points of damage per mast. If the ship performing this manoeuvre lacks a battering ram, it also takes half the damage inflicted.

_Boarding._ Boarding is possible if an opposed Sailing test succeeds. In this case, the vessels are roped together, and boarding can commence. A free Sailing test for boarding is allowed immediately after a successful ramming manoeuvre if desired. If both vessels want to board the other, this is automatic.
