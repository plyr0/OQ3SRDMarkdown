# OQ3 SRD Skills

## The Basic Skill Test

The basic skill test is the unifying rules mechanic that does everything in OpenQuest. Roll a D100 and compare the result against a skill and depending on the result, apply the effect of success or failure.

To make a skill test, the player first describes what their character is doing. Then they roll a D100 and compare this to the relevant skill's score. If the dice roll is equal to or less than the skill's score, the attempt is successful. The player then describes the character's success. If the total is higher than the skill's score, then it has failed. The Referee then describes the result of the character's failure.

Under normal conditions, a skill test is asked for when the character is placed on the spot and must make a successful action under pressure.

### Unstressed Skill Tests

If the character has lots of time, has the tools of their trade and is in a sufficiently relaxed environment and state of mind, they complete the task to the best of their ability.

For example, an apprentice potter (Craft 20%) will, day in day out, produce a couple of pots of passable quality if working at their Master's workshop. Of course, work beyond the skill of the character is still out of their reach, unless the player decides to take the chance with the dice and ask for a skill test.

A local noble wants an artistic piece of pottery for a grand celebration later in the month. The noble's servant comes to the potter's workshop, looking for the Master, who is out. The apprentice, seeing a chance to gain a good reputation, takes the commission. Knowing that his regular work will not be up to scratch, the player decides to roll the dice in the chance that he can produce something of the standard the noble expects.

### If the Outcome is Hazardous

BEFORE THE SKILL TEST IS MADE, the Referee should also outline what any potential hazards there are if the character should fail. Players should be allowed to choose an alternative course of action. Also, the Referee should not apply extra penalties if the skill test is failed, or even fumbled (see below).

## The Basic Skill Test Procedure

Overall, the procedure is as follows.

1. The Referee calls for a skill test and asks the player to roll against a specific skill to resolve the current situation.
2. The player describes how their character is tackling the task at hand.
3. If there are any hazards or penalties for failing the task, the Referee should declare them, and the player should be allowed the option to plot an alternative route for their character, which may allow them to change the skill being used.
4. If the character has any active magic from spells or items that gives them a bonus or penalty, apply this to the skill now.
5. The Referee decides if the situation modifies the difficulty of the skill roll. Whether there is a bonus or a penalty (but not both and not multiple modifiers) to be applied to the skill before the player rolls the dice. See Difficulty below.
6. The player rolls D100 and compares it against their skill, which may be modified.

- If the roll is lower or equal to the skill's value, they succeed. The player describes how the character succeeds.
- If it is higher, they fail. The Referee describes how they fail.
- If they succeed and both dice are the same number, then the result is a critical success.
- If they fail and both dice are the same number, then the result is a fumble.

## Success

If you roll equal to or lower than your modified skill total, you are successful.

You can now describe what the character does as they succeed.

The character gets an automatic success if the modified skill is over 100%, but you still roll to see if you get a critical success.

### **Critical Successes**

If the dice roll on a skill test is successful and both dice are the same (i.e. '11', '22', '33', etc.), then a critical success is achieved.

Critical success has an outcome that far exceeds the expectation of the player. It's the best possible result based upon what skill the character used to perform the test.

The actual result of a critical success during a skill test is up to the player. It usually achieves one of the following results:

- Quicker.
- The result is to a higher standard.
- With more style, impressing any audience they may have.
- The character gains additional information or insight from the task thanks to their brilliance.
- If the character is causing damage as a result of the skill test, they cause maximum damage and ignore any armour or protection that their opponent may have.

The Referee can moderate the critical result, vetoing or suggesting more reasonable outcomes if the player tries to narrate more success than is reasonable, but the player always suggests the effect.

## Failure

If the dice roll on a skill test is higher than the modified skill, then a failure occurs. The Referee narrates the failure and its effect.

Note: The Referee should take care not to penalise the character with multiple effects for failing. The result of failing should be straightforward and as a direct result of the character's actions.

If the Referee has previously outlined the risks of failure, then they should implement that as a result. They should not suddenly change their mind.

### **Failing Forward**

Failure of a basic skill test should never stop the character from progressing through the adventure. There should always be options and possibilities, even when the player fails a skill test. A process which is known as failing forward.

Here are some examples of fail forward situations.

- The characters fail to pick or force a locked door? Their efforts make enough noise to alert a patrol of passing guards, who now come crashing through the door ready for trouble. The characters must think fast, do they respond with violence or make up a convincing story and fast talk their way past the guards?
- The characters all failed their Perception skill tests to notice an iron key hidden in a rubbish pile while searching a room earlier, and now that they have found a locked chest. Will they break it open or get their lock picks out?
- The group's Sorcerer failed their Language skill test to decipher an ancient text about an ancient Demon they are about to face. The adventurers still face the horror, but they do not know its weaknesses or the spell that the scroll outlined.

Failure should not be a barrier to resolving the adventure but instead should open interesting difficulties to resolve.

### **Fumbles**

Whenever a skill test results in failure and both rolled dice are the same number, the character has 'fumbled' the test.

A fumble is the worst possible outcome of the skill test based upon the player's original description of what their character was planning to do.

The actual result of a fumble is primarily up to the Referee to decide. It usually results in one of the following mishaps.

A fumble need not lead to damage and the demise of the character, but should always cause the character to suffer a significant disadvantage.

### Fumbling Forward?

Unlike a simple failure, fumbling should be a dead end to play, to emphasise how bad things are. All the character can do is dust themselves off and take another route to success.

There are specific Critical Success and Fumble results for weapon skill tests in combat and magical casting skill tests, described in the relevant chapters (Combat and Magic).

## Difficulty

If the conditions and situation are different from those usual, the Referee may modify the skill to reflect the difference in difficulty. Modifiers are added or subtracted from the skill for the duration of the test. A penalty will make the test harder while a bonus makes it easier. Only one modifier is used during a test. (See When a Referee Should Apply Difficulty Modifiers below for guidance on this.)

***Difficulty Modifiers***

| **Difficulty** | **Skill Modifier** | **What the modifier means** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | +50% | The character should have an almost certain chance of success. |
| Simple | +20% | While success is still by no means certain, the character has a boost to their chance of achieving their goal. |
| Normal | +0% | The skill is unmodified since normal conditions apply. |
| Difficult | –20% | Significantly hindered in their chance of success. |
| Hard | –50% | Suffering a severe setback that may put success beyond their reach. |

## Impossible Success And Automatic Failure

Any skill modified to 0 or less will automatically fail when tested. Roll dice anyway since the character can still fumble.

Any skill modified to 100% or higher will almost always automatically succeed when tested. Roll the dice anyway since the character can be still make a critical success or fumble if the player rolls a 00. This rule of 00 being an automatic fumble does not apply to a character who is a Master of the skill.

## When the Referee Should Apply Difficulty Modifiers

Modifiers should only be applied when they have a significant effect on the character's chance of success. They should not be doled out for every skill test since this cheapens their dramatic impact. Only apply a modifier when it is essential and brings something to the story. Resist the urge to hand out +10% here and take -5% there. These little modifiers do not add much to the player's chance of success and bring needless fiddly addition and subtraction into play.

There are three areas where the Referee should modify the player's skill before a skill test. The Referee should consider all three areas and decide which of them provides the deciding factor, and only apply the modifier based on that.

For example, if the player has roleplayed his character to the hilt while influencing a guardsman in the pouring rain, it is the roleplaying for which the Referee awards a +50% bonus and not the rain, which would have dampened the enthusiasm of the guardsman to -20%. So, only +50% applies to the player's roll.

The three areas are:

- As a result of the task being inherently easy or difficult.
- As a result of planning.
- As a result of good roleplaying.

### As a Result of the Task Being Inherently Easy or Difficult

Some things are just naturally easier or harder to do than others.

For example, climbing a cliff with natural handholds and with the proper equipment (e.g. ropes and iron spikes) is an unmodified task. Doing the same climb in the pouring rain makes it Difficult (-20% to the skill) and if the character has also forgotten his ropes and spikes, then this makes it Hard (-50% to the skill).

In comparison, climbing a cliff where there are numerous ledges, and where the character can rest and actually 'walk' up the cliff in places becomes an Easy (+50%) skill test.

### As a Result of Planning

The players have outlined how their characters prepare to perform a task well in advance. If their plan is a sound and good one, you should make the skill test Easy. Conversely, if the players have given no thought as to how their characters approach a complex task which does require preparation and planning, then make the resulting skill test Hard.

### As a Result of Good Roleplaying

Usually, this happens with skills that involve some form of communication, like Influence. When the player describes the action of their character and roleplays the exchange between their character and the non-player character(s). If the player was entertaining, kept in character and added to the fun of the game, the Referee may award them a +20% or +50% bonus. In exceptional circumstances, where the player reduced everyone to tears of laughter or was outstanding in their portrayal of their character, the Referee may waive the necessity for the skill test entirely. Remember, good storytelling always comes before any dice rolling.

## Modifiers for Magic

Suppose the character is under the influence of a magic spell or item, that gives them a penalty or bonus to the skill they are using. In this case, the modifier for magic is added or subtracted after the modifier for difficulty.

Like modifiers for difficulty, apply one modifier in any given skill test. Pick the most powerful one, be it a bonus or a penalty.

## Opposed Skill Tests

Opposed skill tests are made by both characters who are in direct competition with each other. Both characters make the skill tests, as usual, rolling 1D100 and attempting to roll equal to or under their skill.

### One Character Succeeds

If one character succeeds their skill test and the other fails, then the successful character has won the opposed skill test.

### Both Characters Succeed

If both characters succeed, then whoever rolled the highest in their skill test wins the opposed test. If one character rolls a critical, while the other rolls an ordinary success, then the character that rolled the critical, which is a higher level of success, wins.

### Both Characters Fail

Whoever rolled the lowest in their skill test wins the opposed test.

In the case of ties for both the player wins.

### Difficulty Modifiers in Opposed Skill Tests

Only one side of the opposed skill test is modified. Either whoever has the clear advantage or clear disadvantage. You do not modify both sides.

### Magic in an Opposed Skill Test

Both sides can use magic in an opposed skill test, which generates skill modifiers. Like a normal skill test these modifiers are applied after the difficulty modifier.

***Opposed Tests Results***

| **Player / Opponent** | **Critical** | **Success** | **Failure** | **Fumble** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Highest Roll Wins | Player Wins | Player Wins | Player Wins |
| Success | Opponent Wins | Highest Roll Wins | Player Wins | Player Wins |
| Failure | Opponent Wins | Opponent Wins | Lowest Roll wins | Player Wins |
| Fumble | Opponent Wins | Opponent Wins | Opponent Wins | Nobody Wins |

## Skills at 100%

Characters with skills at the limit of 100% are Masters of that skill and under normal circumstances do not fail and quite often can perform tasks that are deemed impossible by ordinary people.

### Skill Tests and Masters

Characters who have 100% with a particular skill never roll to test their skill, and the outcome is an automatic critical. Because they do not need to test their skill, they never fail or fumble skill tests with that skill.

### Opposed Tests vs Masters

In opposed skill tests characters with skills at 100% nearly always succeed. There are two cases that need consideration.

If the player character is a Master and their opponent is also a Master. In this case, the player rolls the dice as normal, and if they get a critical, they win the contest. Otherwise, they tie, and the contest is a standoff with neither side getting any advantage.

If the opponent is a Master and the character is not. The player rolls the test for their character's skill. The Master has already considered to have a critical by the fact that they are at 100%, so the Referee needs not roll. If player rolls a critical, the player character wins by the barest and most amazing of margins. If the player succeeds, the Master wins in less style than they normally would, which might be impressive in its own right to any crowd watching. The player character rolls a fail or fumble, they fumble.

### Characters Whose skill is Modified to 100%

Characters who during a basic skill test or opposed skill contest have their skill modified to 100%, are not treated as Masters. While a modified skill of 100% still guarantees them a success, unless they fumble a roll of 00, they still have to roll to see if they get a critical.

## Group Skill Tests

Sometimes the Referee will call for everyone around the table to make the same skill test. These tests are made as individuals. For example, a Perception Test to notice the bandits hidden in the bushes on either side of the path the characters are currently travelling along. Those characters who make their tests can act on the information that it provides. Those who don't can't. Characters can also critical or fumble as normal. Determining Surprise in the Combat chapter is another example of this.

## Assistance

Characters will often help each other during skill tests. Often such assistance will break a deadlock where a character cannot successfully do a task on their own. Only one assistance may be taken at a time, but it may add to the modifier that the character making the skill test has already gained. Note: If the character is doing this in combat, they act on the turn of the character they are helping. They lose their own turn. Therefore, they cannot assist if they have already acted in that round.

Assistance Procedure.

1. Choose an appropriate skill, which need not be the same as the skill which the character they are assisting is using. Make the skill roll and narrate how your character is helping.
2. The Referee determines if the character is actually in a position to help.
3. If the Referee approves, add +20% to the skill of the character you are helping.

## Skill Descriptions

Here is the full list of skills in alphabetical order.

### Athletics (DEX+STR)

This broad skill covers a range of athletic activities useful to adventuring characters, including acrobatics, climbing, jumping and swimming.

_Acrobatics:_ This allows a character to perform a variety of gymnastics and balancing tasks, such as tumbling, walking a tightrope or keeping balance on a narrow or unstable ledge. The character can move at half their normal speed across an unstable surface without penalty. To move at a normal rate requires an Acrobatics test. A successful Acrobatics test will also halve the damage suffered from falling.

_Brute Force:_ Brute force is an application of Athletics that relies purely on power, with no finesse involved. Brute force involves pushing, lifting or dragging.

_Climbing:_ Given enough hand and footholds, a character can climb any surface, given enough time, without the need for a test. Under normal circumstances, a character can ascend or descend one-quarter of their Movement per Combat Round (see Chapter 5 Combat for details). A character can double the rate of their climb or descent by making a Hard Athletics test.

_Jumping:_ In general, a successful Athletics test allows a character to jump up to twice their height horizontally or up to half their height vertically, if they have at least five metres to run first. For standing jumps, half these distances. For humans, average height is roughly 1.8m which gives a jumping distance of 4m.

For greater distances, the Referee can apply a -20% or even -50% penalty. If the distance involved is absurd, the Referee should feel free to say the test is impossible

_Swimming:_ Characters usually swim at half their usual movement. Athletics tests are only required when conditions are less than ideal – swimming while heavily encumbered or in strong currents, for example.

### Close Combat (DEX+STR)

This skill deals with the art of hitting things and defending the character with melee weapons, such as swords, clubs, spears, polearms and shields.

### Craft(INT+10)

This skill is a grouping of several disciplines, that measures the character's ability to make and repair items.

As a very rough guide, it takes one day per 50 SP to produce an item. The base cost of the article in materials needed is 50% of the listed finished value.

### Culture (Own) (INT+10) /Culture (Other) (INT)

Each Culture skill provides information about the prevailing worldview of that group of people (or creatures), which includes history, politics, weather cycles, geography, superstitions, and popular mythology.

Culture (Own) is the worldview of the people by whom the character is raised. All other foreign or alien cultures are Culture (Other). Culture (Other) is a collection of skills, one for each culture.

### Deception (DEX+INT)

Deception covers the arts of:

_Disguise:_ Used to change a character's appearance and adopt a different outward persona.

_Sleight:_ Used to hide or take objects, without drawing undue attention.

_Stealth:_ Used whenever a character attempts to evade detection by another character personally. Usually, this happens when a character either tries to creep past an enemy, hide from one, or performs a combination of both.

When testing the skill, Deception is often opposed by the Perception skill and is modified according to the situation. Note that attempts at Fast Talk use the Influence skill rather than Deception.

### Dodge (DEX+10)

The Dodge skill is used to avoid incoming objects that are swung or thrown at the character. The skill is usually used when a character attempts to dodge an incoming blow in combat or a physical hazard that can be avoided, such as falling masonry.

### Driving (DEX+INT)

If a character is driving a wagon, chariot, or similar vehicle, at no more than walking pace across flat terrain, a Driving skill test will never be required. Skill tests are needed when a character wants to do something out of the ordinary with a vehicle – such as to travel across treacherous terrain, jump obstacles and so on.

### Engineering (INT+10)

This skill is used to design, build, activate, repair, sabotage or disassemble large mechanisms or constructs, such as siege machines, city gates and drawbridges, mine-shafts, sailing ships and so forth.

### Healing (INT+10)

Use of this skill will always require a healer's kit, which includes suitable medical equipment, such as bandages and salves, or an appropriate improvised alternative. Each use of the Healing skill generally takes a few minutes to perform. Both characters must remain stationary and may not use combat actions or reactions while this occurs or they will lose the benefits of the healing.

See the following table for the range of Healing actions available to the characters using this skill.

All healing actions are stressful, so they always require a skill test to perform successfully.

***Healing Actions***

| **Injury or Ailment** | **Treatment** |
| --- | --- |
| Unconsciousness | A successful Healing test can revive a character from unconsciousness. |
| Minor Injury (any wound taken while total hit points over zero) | A successful Healing test on a Minor Injury will heal 1D6 Hit Points. |
| Stabilise Mortal Wound (character less than zero hit points) | A successful Healing test on a Mortal Wound (where hit points are less than zero) will not restore the lost Hit Points. This Healing merely stabilises the patient enough so that they will not die of blood loss. |
| Curing Diseases | A successful Healing test allows a diseased patient to add a bonus to his next opposed test of Resilience versus disease Potency to resist the disease. The bonus is equal to the healer's Healing skill divided by 10. |
| Curing Poisons | A successful Healing test allows a poisoned patient to attempt a second opposed test of Resilience versus poison Potency. The patient gains a bonus to their Resilience skill equal to the healer's Healing skill divided by 10. |
| Surgery | Other than magical healing, successful Surgery is the only way that a character can recover from a Mortal Wound. Once a successful Healing test has been made to quench the bleeding of a Mortal Wound, a successful Healing test can attempt to set broken bones, stitch together rent flesh and restore the wound location so that it is on the road to recovery. If the Healing test is a success, the stricken character gains one hit point and will begin to heal as usual. |

### Influence (CHA+10)

This skill is the art of verbally persuading another character to do what you want.

Influence skill tests are usually opposed by either Persistence (as a measure of sheer bloody-minded will power) or Influence (where the character argues back). They are further modified by how much a character is trying to change an opponent's mind. Influence skill tests are often modified by how well the player roleplays the exchange (see "When the Referee should apply difficulty modifiers" above).

Influence can be used in one of three ways.

- _Fast Talk_. The character tries to quickly confuse either an individual or small group with a clear leader, into doing what they want.
- _Oratory._ The character puts forward a series of arguments to sway a large crowd of people.
- _Intimidation_. The character tries to use the threat of violence against an opponent or group of opponent.

See the Social Combat section for more.

### Language (Own) (Int+50)/Language (Other) (INT)

The Language skill is several separate skills grouped under a single heading. Language (Gatanese), Language (Dark Lander) and Language (Goblinoid), for example, are all individual skills.

Every character with a Language skill of 50% or more is fluent in that language, although they are likely to have an accent if it is not their native language.

A score in a Language skill of 80% or more will mean the character can also read and write in that language.

### Lore (Area of Knowledge) (INT)

The Lore skill is an umbrella term for several different skills, each of which must be improved separately.

Each Lore skill defines an area of knowledge for the character, and whenever a player wants to see if their character knows something about the subject at hand they use that specific Lore skill.

A player's imagination is the only limit to the range of possible Lores. Example Lores include: alchemy, art, astronomy, gambling, geography, heraldry, law, logistics, military tactics, philosophy, poisons.

### Mechanisms (DEX+INT)

The Mechanisms skill is used for picking a lock or disassembling a trap. Usually, this takes at least one minute (12 combat rounds) to perform, whereas larger or particularly complex devices will take longer.

Usually, a character will merely make a Mechanisms test to succeed at assembling or disassembling a device, with appropriate bonuses or penalties decided upon by the Referee. If a device has been designed to resist attempts at disassembly specifically, the Mechanisms test becomes opposed by the Mechanisms skill of the character who created it.

### Natural Lore (INT+10)

Broadly speaking, this Lore deals with the character's knowledge of the natural world. It can be broken into five specialist areas.

_Animal:_ This covers the ability to recognise an animal, know its feeding habits, breeding cycle, habitats and so on. A character with a skill of at least 50% may try to domesticate a wild animal, making a skill test after every full week of training. If the character also has a Riding skill of at least 50% and the animal is capable of being ridden, they may train the animal to be ridden during this period. The character may later train the animal not to panic in battle and to strike at his enemies, after a further period of training, with the character making a skill test at the end of each week to succeed.

_Plant:_ A character can identify plants in the wild, discover the right places to grow crops, decide which plants are edible and what unusual properties they may possess.

_Mineral:_ This skill allows the character to detect precious metals and stones, detect fault lines and other dangerous features in the rock, etc.

_Survival:_ One Survival test will be required every day that a character lacks either food, water or a safe place to sleep. Success indicates the character manages to find whatever they lack – failure means they will go without, which over several days could result in severe consequences. Survival tests aren't called for when the character is in a city or town.

_Tracking:_ With this skill, a character can locate the tracks of a specific creature and follow them while in the wilderness.

_Weather:_ The character can predict changes in the climate.

### Perception (INT+POW)

The Perception skill is used to represent the five senses of the character when detecting objects or other characters. For example, a typical use of the Perception skill is as a straight skill test to identify hidden objects in a room or as an opposed test to discover a hidden character.

### Performance (CHA+10)

A successful test with this skill will result in the audience or partner being pleased by the character's performance. This skill covers acting, composing poetry, dancing, singing, readings and playing an instrument.

### Persistence (POW+10)

Persistence represents a character's mental willpower. It is used to resist the effects of magic and to resist another character's attempt to use the Influence skill against them.

### Personal Magic Casting (POW X 3)

This skill represents the character's ability to cast Personal Magic spells. It also describes their knowledge about Personal Magic (see the dedicated chapter for further details).

### Ranged Combat (DEX+ INT)

This skill covers the use of missile weapons, such as bows, crossbows, thrown spears and thrown daggers. See the Combat chapter for more detail.

### Religion (Own) (INT+10)/Religion(Other)(INT)

Religion is used to recall knowledge of a religious nature, though the character will only be able to remember knowledge pertinent to the specified religion.

Learning Religion (Own) requires a character to be at least a lay member of a religion. Normally, a character will only be a member of one religion. So, Religion (Other) usually relates to foreign religions and is learned through observation or being taught by a member of the religion in question.

The Religion skill is not needed actually to cast Divine magic. Still, it is used to advance in status and power within the Religions that the character is a member of and to grant access to higher magnitudes of Divine magic.

### Resilience (CON+POW)

A measure of how physically tough a character is. The higher a character's Resilience, the more likely they are to handle adverse physical conditions, such as weathering a vicious sandstorm, surviving in a drought or overcoming the effects of poison or disease.

### Riding (DEX+POW)

If a character is riding a creature with the help of saddle and stirrups, at no more than a walking pace across flat terrain, then a Riding test will never be required. Tests are required when a character wants to do something out of the ordinary with a mount – such as travel across treacherous terrain, jump obstacles, ride bareback and so on.

### Sailing (DEX+INT)

This skill covers small water-borne craft propelled manually by oars or paddles, commonly known as boats, and larger craft powered by sail or rows of oars. Travelling across calm water does not usually require a skill test, but adverse conditions such as currents and weather can bestow penalties.

### Sorcery Casting (INT)

This skill covers the successful casting of Sorcery spells which the caster knows, and also the ability to manipulate the effects, range and duration of those spells. This skill also allows the use of magic items with stored spells (commonly called Matrices) and scrolls with Sorcery spells written on them. It can also be used to represent the character's knowledge of Sorcery and its works. See the Sorcery Chapter for details.

### Streetwise (CHA+POW)

Streetwise allows a character to find fences for stolen goods, black markets and uncover general information in an urban setting. Such uses of Streetwise usually require a minimum of 1D4 hours. Streetwise also covers following people down crowded city streets.

### Trade (INT+10)

This skill is used when characters trade, barter or otherwise negotiate over the sale of goods. In such transactions, a successful opposed test using the Trade of the buyer versus the Trade of the seller is needed for the buyer to get the best deal. If the buyer wins, they receive a discount, -10% for success, -20% for a critical. If the seller wins, the price that they can sell the item for increases by +10% for success and +20% for a critical. If the opponent fumbles their roll, double the increase or decrease.

The Trade skill also enables the character to determine the value placed on something by others; by estimating its market value. Everyday or obscure objects might give a bonus or penalty to the skill test. Success will allow a character to guess the average monetary value of the object, usually guessing accurately to within 10% of its actual value.

### Unarmed Combat (DEX+STR)

This skill covers the use of natural attacks. For humans, this is punching, kicking, and grappling. Non-human characters may also have bite, horn, claw and tail attacks.

| **Weapon** | **Damage Dice** |
| --- | --- |
| Unarmed | 1D4 |
| Natural weaponry | As noted, typically 1D4 to 1D12 depending on the creature (see Creature Chapters) |

### Wealth (Optional) (INT+CHA)

This skill shows the resources and physical possessions a character has. For a beginning character, it is based upon what they have earned using their wits and charm alone. The basic skill is (INT + CHA), and this can be increased by spending skill points at character generation. If you are determining starting wealth by social class, set the minimum in the skill according to social rank (i.e. the base score as shown in the table below). For example, a Minor Noble would have a Wealth of 86%.

Wealth can be used as an abstract measure of material resources in the game. A character who has the equivalent Wealth level to a piece of equipment's purchase cost can automatically buy it. If the piece of equipment's cost is one level above the character's wealth, then the character will need to make a wealth test.

If they succeed, the item is theirs. The next wealth test is at -20%. This modifier lasts for a month.

If they fail, they do not have enough spare cash at the time that they try to buy the item and must free up some of their savings or wait until they are paid again at the end of their current job.

If they fumble, they will find that they have a cash flow problem and cannot make any Wealth tests for at least a month, and they must spend time and effort sorting out their financial difficulties.

If they roll a critical, they find they have more than enough disposable income and can make their next Wealth test without a penalty.

***What Wealth Means***

| **Wealth %** | **Description** | **Social Class** | **Financial Situation.** | **Equipment** | **Housing** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 and lower | Destitute | Beggars and the displaced. | Outside of the normal economy and unable to support themselves. | Rags, discarded tools, subsistence food- usually scraps. | Streets or in a slum. |
