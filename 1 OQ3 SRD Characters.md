# OQ3 SRD Characters

## Character Generation

* * *

OpenQuest character generation is a seven-step process and, at each step, the player makes decisions about what their character is like at the beginning of the game, when the character is just starting on their adventuring career.

### Character Concept

A character concept is a one-sentence summing up of what the character is all about.

#### Step 1: Determine Concept

In one sentence, sum up what your character is all about. Use the guidelines above to give yourself ideas. Ask the other players what their character concepts are to make sure the group has an exciting selection of characters.

Check with your Referee that your character concept fits in with the type of game that the group is going to be playing.

### Characteristics

The characteristics are:

_Strength (STR):_ A character's capability with brute force, strength affects the amount of damage they deal, how much they can lift and so on.

_Constitution (CON):_ A measure of the character's health, constitution affects how much damage they can sustain in combat, as well as general resistance to disease and other illnesses.

_Dexterity (DEX):_ Dexterity is the character's agility, coordination and speed of reactions. This ability aids a character in many physical actions, including combat.

_Size (SIZ): Size_ is an indication of the character's mass and, like strength and constitution, affects the amount of damage a character can deal, and how well they can absorb damage.

_Intelligence (INT):_ A character's ability to think around problems, analyse information and memorise instructions.

_Power (POW):_ Power is a measure of the character's life force, the strength of their willpower, and a measure of how much magic power they have. It is a beneficial characteristic for those interested in becoming accomplished spellcasters.

_Charisma (CHA):_ This quantifies a character's attractiveness and leadership qualities.

#### Step 2: Generate Characteristics

##### Using the Points Method

Each characteristic starts with a value of 8. You have thirty points to distribute to increase them. The maximum value of a characteristic during character generation is 18. You may also lower a characteristic to gain extra points. For example, reduce STR from 8 to 6 to gain 2 points. Note that INT and SIZ cannot be decreased below 8. Other characteristics have a minimum value of 3, although such a low value would indicate that the character has a severe disadvantage in this area.

##### Random Generation of Characteristics (Optional)

If you prefer a more traditional method of rolling dice to create characteristics, follow this process.

For humans.

| **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **SIZ** | **INT** | **POW** | **CHA** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3D6 | 3D6 | 3D6 | 2D6+6 | 2D6+6 | 3D6 | 3D6 |

### Attributes

Attributes are a set of secondary scores that define the character's potential to do and take physical damage, how quickly they move, and the amount of magical energy available to the character. The character's characteristic scores determine the value of their attributes.

_Damage Modifier (DM):_ The Damage Modifier applies whenever the character uses a melee or thrown weapon. It's calculated by adding the character's Strength and Size together and referring to the table below. The modifier gets more significant when the sum of Strength and Size are higher –bigger, stronger, characters deal out more damage than smaller, weaker, characters.

***Damage Modifier***

| **Total of STR and SIZ** | **Damage Modifier** |
| --- | --- |
| 1–10 | –1D6 \* |
| 11–15 | –1D4 \* |
| 16–25 | +0 |
| 26–30 | +1D4 |
| 31–45 | +1D6 |
| 46–60 | +2D6 |
| 61-75 | +3D6 |
| 76-90 | +4D6 |
| Every additional + 15 | +1D6 |

\*If after you have taken away the rolled damage modifier and the damage is under 0, increase it to 1.

_Hit points (HP):_ These determine how much damage the character can sustain before reaching unconsciousness or death.

_Magic points (MP):_ A measure of the character's magical energy.Used to activate any spells the character knows.

_Movement rate (MR):_ This is the amount in metres that a character can move in a five-second Combat Round.

#### Step 3: Determine Attributes

To work out your character's damage modifier, add Strength and Size together and look at the Damage Modifier table.

Hit points equal Size plus Constitution divided by 2, rounded up.

The character's starting magic points will be equal to the character's POW.

Human characters have a Movement rate of 15 metres.

### Skills

Skills are things that the character can do. They represent particular areas of expertise. In-game, the percentage value of the skill is rolled against, using a D100, to work out if a character completes a task in the game. A roll equal to or less than the skill percentage indicates a success.

For example.

Ethelred has a Dodge of 52%, which means that in combat he has to roll 52 or under on D100 to avoid the incoming blows of his opponent.

#### What do the Numbers Mean?

The following table translates the skill percentage into a 'real world' description of the level of expertise.

***Skill Expertise***

| **Skill** | **Expertise** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-25% | Novice | No experience with the skill and is relying on raw talent and beginner's luck. |
| 26-50% | Apprentice | This level of expertise represents someone actively learning the skill. |
| 51-75% | Veteran | The character is competent with the basic uses of the skill, which they use in everyday life. |
| 76-99% | Expert | This character is a local expert at the skill, who can perform it under most conditions with ease and elegance. |
| 100% | Master | They are acknowledged as best at that skill, and regularly perform the impossible in challenging conditions. |

100% is the upper limit for skills, either through improvement or by being modified before a skill roll. Characters with skills at 100% are Masters of their skills, and always automatically succeed with a critical effect.

#### Skill Lists

Skills categorised for easy reference.

_Resistances_ are skills that get the character out of harm's way.

_Combat skills_ measure the character's skills in physical violence.

_Knowledge skills_ measure the intellectual abilities of the character.

_Practical skills_ measure the character's ability to perform a variety of everyday and specialist tasks.

_Magic skills_ cover either casting magic or knowledge of religious practices.

_A note about skills with descriptors in brackets._ Lore (Type), Religion (Other Religion) and Culture (Other) all have a descriptor in brackets after the main skill name

#### Skill Bases

***Resistances***

| Religion (Other Religion) | INT |

#### Step 4: Calculate Skills

For each skill, calculate the starting skill value, also known as the base score, from the calculation provided. Then write it down on the character sheet next to the skill.

During character generation, the player gets a pool of points to spend on each group of skills. Distribute points between the skills, with a limit of no more than 30 to be allocated to any one skill.

_Resistances:_ Spend 50 points between the three skills.

_Combat:_ Spend 50 points between the three skills.

_Knowledge:_ Spend 50 points between the skills.

_Practical:_ Spend 75 points between skills.

_Magic:_ is special, refer to Generating a Character Step 5 below.

### Magic

#### Step 5: Magic Spells

Look at the spells in the Personal Magic chapter and pick six points of magnitude worth. Also work out Personal Magic Casting Skill, which starts at POW X 3.

### Equipment

Each character typically starts with some money and the tools of their trade.

#### Step 6: Cash and Equipment

- Starting cash is 4D6 x 10 in silver pieces unless you are using the optional rules to abstract resources using the Wealth skill.
- Each character starts with one of the two arms and armour packages below:
- Leather armour, ranged weapon, close combat 2H weapon and dagger.
- Leather armour, a medium or small shield, ranged weapon, close combat 1H weapon and dagger.
- Also, each character starts with the following equipment:
- A backpack, rope, two weeks' worth of travelling provisions, flint and tinder, and a waterskin.

Your Referee may allow you to buy additional equipment before the game starts from the character's starting cash.

### Finishing Off the Character

#### General Information

_Age:_ Human characters start at any age between 18 and 28. To randomly determine this, roll 2D6 and add 16.

_Fortune points:_ Every character starts with two fortune points.

#### What are Fortune Points?

Fortune points are what distinguishes the player character from the average stay at home type folk. They represent their good fortune and ability to escape life-threatening situations with ease.

Fortune points allow the player character to do any of the following in game.

- Re-roll any failed dice roll.
- Flip the existing dice result for a failed test so that the units are now the tens and the tens are now the units, so that it is a success.
- Avoid character death. Instead of dying, the character, if reduced to zero or fewer hit points, is merely unconscious. The character remains in such a state until the combat is over, at which point they awaken with one hit point.
- If the character uses Divine Magic, they can spend fortune points invoke their deity and regain a cast spell of their choosing.

Once spent, fortune points are gone. The Referee awards fortune at the end of the game session for moments of outstanding heroic play.

In an average Quest, each character should also receive two fortune points. Modify this total if the character has performed particularly poorly or heroically, giving a range of between zero and four fortune points to be awarded.

#### Background, Appearance and Personality

Even if you do not create a fully written-up background, it is worth making a mental note of what the character is like as a person and roughly what their background is previous to play, as well as visualising what they look like.

#### The Character's Background

The background is useful not only to give the character history before the game starts but also as a way of noting all the intangible elements of the character's personality. Ethelred's story later in this chapter is an example of a background.

Writing down a background is optional and can be done either before or after character generation or can even emerge during play.

#### **Motives**

Motives are what drives the character's actions. They are the character's goals, both short and long-term.

Saga Motives are life motives and are only achievable throughout a linked set of adventures, commonly known as a 'campaign' or Saga as OpenQuest calls it.

Quest Motives are usually relevant to the adventure currently being played and are determined near the beginning of the session by the players.

At the end of character generation, choose one Saga Motive for your character and at the beginning of the adventure, choose a suitable Quest Motive.

#### Step 7: Finish Off the Character

Note down fortune points and age.

For humans, this is 18-28 (2D6+16) respectively for starter adventurers.

Fortune points starts at 2.

Create at a Saga Motive for the character

If you want to include a background narrative, then do this now.

Finally, if you haven't done so already, write the character's name on the character sheet.

## Non-human adventurers (Optional)

* * *

With the Referee's permission, your character may be one of the creatures found in the Creatures chapter.

Use the random method to determine characteristics and roll the dice.

or

Take the value in brackets as the starting point and add ten points amongst them. Characteristics cannot be increased above the maximum value permitted by the random method (i.e. the maximum rollable plus three).

Make a note of the special abilities, traits, movement rates, natural armour and the natural weapons of the creature; damage base is as given, and skills start at Base Value.

Then determine skills and magic as normal, perhaps using the weapons and skills on the creature description which depict an average member of the species as a guide.

## Ready-Made Concepts

* * *

Ready-made concepts give quick ideas for players who are struggling to decide which skills and magic to choose.

Follow the character generation process up to the section on spending points on skills and choosing magic (steps 4 & 5). Instead of step 4 and 5, use the skill points and magic spells allocation as listed for the concept. Roll for money as normal but write down all the suggested equipment on the character sheet instead of the normal default adventuring starting equipment.

Each concept has the following components:

A name. A one-sentence summary of the concept.

• Skills. A ready-made points allocation for each of the skills groups.

• Personal Magic. Non-variable spells have the magic point cost in square brackets.

• Equipment.

So here we go here's an example of a ready-made concept for players who are stuck for ideas.

### Adventurous and Knowledge-Hungry Scholar

Skills:

Resistances: Dodge +30, Persistence +10, Resilience +10.

Combat: Close Combat+20, Ranged Combat+10, Unarmed Combat +20.

Knowledge: Language (Other) +20, Lore (Ancient Dead Civilisations) +30.

Practical: Athletics + 25, Influence +20, Perception +30.

Personal Magic: Coordination 2, Protection 2, Second Sight [2].

Equipment: Scholar's robes over leather armour, staff or dagger, and sling & stones.

## Character Growth

* * *

As characters go on Quests, they grow and improve. In the game, this can be one of the tangible goals for the players.

The main currency for achieving this and indicator of how well the character is doing in game terms are growth points or just simply growth. The Referee hands these out after a Quest.

Growth can happen because of three situations.

- _Bringing motives into play_, as determined by the player and approved by the Referee.
- _Quest achievement awards_. These are determined and handed out by the Referee.
- _In game rewards for skill use._ If the player fumbles or criticals during a skill test.
- _Ad hoc growth awards._ The Referee gives these out as a result of certain events occurring during the Quest.

### Awarding Growth for Motives

The characters' motives are the main way players get to drive play and grow their characters.

If your character completes a motive, either short or long term, during a gaming session, cross it out.

If you engage with a motive in a gaming session, bringing it in to play, but don't complete it, put a \* next to it. You can only mark growth once in this way per Quest.

Make sure you make these marks as soon as your character achieves them with your Referee's permission.

At the end of the Quest, look at your motives.

+5 growth points if you complete your Saga motive.

+2 growth points if you complete your Quest motive.

+1 for every motive that is brought into play. You don't get this award as well as the award for completing a motive.

As a result, you should have a total between 1 growth point (you engaged with your short-term Quest motive) and 7 growth points (you complete both your Quest motive and Saga motive).

At this point, rub out any asterisk markers and remove any short-term motives, whether completed or not. Leave the completed long-term motives on the character sheet.

#### **Motive Review**

At the end of each Quest, the player and the Referee can call for a Motive Review. During the review, the player can change Saga Motives that are no longer interesting to them or relevant to the character. They can also remove uncompleted Quest Motives or carry them over to the next Quest, in which case the Referee makes a note of them.

### Referee Growth Awards

The Referee award character growth as a result of the following.

- _Quest achievement award_ is directly linked to how long the quest was.
- _In game rewards for skill use._ If a character fumbles or criticals during a skill test, their player adds a growth point immediately.
- _Ad Hoc awards_ that acknowledge growth that occurs due to achievements outside of the standard growth system.

#### Quest Achievement Awards

At the end of a Quest, the Referee makes this award, a simple flat award of two growth points for each session of play of average length of two-three hours. Adjust for longer sessions.

For example, A self-contained one session one-shot game that took three hours should give two growth points, while a Quest that took four sessions, each two to three hours, to play out gives eight growth points to each player.

Note: if you want to reward clever or entertaining play, use fortune points instead.

#### In Game Rewards for Skill Use

If a character fumbles or criticals during a skill-test, they grow from the experience and the player immediately records a one-point growth award. The table should also cheer on the player. There is no limit to how many times this reward can be issued. The reward reflects this author's belief that we grow from great success or great failure.

#### Ad Hoc Awards

Ad hoc means when necessary or needed.

The characters may grow as part of the Quest in ways that are immediate and hard to fit within the context of awarding growth points and the Referee wants to make a one off award of a character growth directly linked to the Quest.

For example.

- A Wise may teach (for free) the spell of Detect Gold as a reward for completing a Quest on their behalf.

### Spending Growth Points

Players may spend growth points in the downtime between Quests, even when their characters who are badly injured are healing. The default downtime period is three months, although it could drop to mere days if the flow of time in the series of Quests, known as a Saga, requires it.

#### Growing Skills

A player may improve any number of skills by spending growth points, but each skill can only go up by +5%, during the downtime between adventures.

The cost of that growth depends on the expertise of the skill.

***Growth Costs by Expertise***

| **Skill** | **Expertise** | **Growth cost Per +5%** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-25% | Novice | 1 |
| 26-50% | Apprentice | 2 |
| 51-75% | Veteran | 3 |
| 76-99% | Expert | 5 |
| 100% | Master | 10 to reach 100% |

#### Growing Characteristics

A player can choose to spend five growth points to increase one characteristic by one point.

SIZ never increases using growth points.

The maximum a human character can increase a characteristic to is 21. For non-humans, the maximum for a characteristic is equal to the maximum possible starting score for the characteristic plus three.

This type of growth allows the character to overcome the innate weaknesses they suffer due to low characteristic scores.

#### Growing Magic

How the character learns more magic is dealt with in the respective magic chapters (Personal Magic, Divine Magic, and Sorcery). But for convenience the costs are summarised in the following table.

***Summary of Growth Costs***

| **Cost** | **Growth** |
| --- | --- |
| One growth point | +5% to Skill |
| Five growth points | +1 to any characteristic except SIZ |
| One growth point per magnitude | Learn a Personal Magic spell |
| Two growth points per magnitude | Learn a spell or an increase the magnitude of a Divine Magic spell |
| Three growth points | Learn a Sorcery Spell |

### Improving Outside of Quests: Practice And Research

The characters may often experience long stretches of downtime between Quests. Group members may need to heal from wounds suffered during the last Quest, the characters may engage in some activity that takes time, or life may return to normal until the next danger to face the player characters appears.

During such downtime, the characters may improve their characters. The players might request downtime between Quests to learn new skills, and it is up to the Referee to determine if this is appropriate.

For every three months of practice or research, a character may gain one growth point, which they can spend on growth. Note skills can only increase by +5% per downtime period.

### Improving in Magical Rank

There are growth point costs when a character increases their rank in their religions and in sorcery, and when they become a specialist caster using Personal Magic—explained in more detail in the relevant chapters, along with the benefits.

### Unlearning Spells and Changing Magical Path

Suppose characters change religions or even magic path. In that case, they may want to free up previously learnt magic spells, to learn a more powerful spell. For example, a character might change spells when they graduate from being Personal Magic users to users of Sorcery or Divine Magic, or learn the Divine Magic of their new religion if they change faith.

Characters may do this during downtime between adventures. The player describes how their character is spending time unlearning the spell and then, as long as they have a teacher or source of the new spell, they can learn it. Also, extra growth points from the character's current pool are added to the growth points freed up by unlearning the spell, to make up the total growth points needed to learn the new spell.

Also, they may return the growth points they spent to become a specialist caster (such as Shaman, Wise, Priest or Adept). They can then spend this growth on spells, or more likely on becoming a specialist caster in their new magical path.
